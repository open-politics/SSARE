network?', 'source': None, 'insertion_date': '2024-11-27T00:00:29.638868', 'text_content': 'When Israel declared last month that it would target a Hezbollah-linked Lebanese microloan charity it triggered a frenzied search for a list of the organisation’s branches.\\n\\nPeople across the country tried to figure out whether they needed to flee their homes where the branches were located before Israel started bombing.\\n\\nAl-Qard Al-Hassan Association (AQAH), a charity that offers interest-free microloans, had grown in prominence over the past decade amid US sanctions and the collapse of Lebanon’s banking sector.\\n\\nHassan lives with his family in Beirut, 200m (655ft) away from a branch of AQAH.\\n\\n“We heard about it from this guy Avichay,” he said, referring to Avichay Adraee, a spokesman in Arabic for the Israeli army who announces evacuation orders on social media.\\n\\n“Then the bombing started in [the southern Beirut suburb of] Dahieh. We could hear it: ‘Boom, boom, boom.’ The kids jump at every ‘boom’.”\\n\\nWith nowhere else to go, Hassan took his family to the seaside, where they spent a sleepless night squeezed together in the car.\\n\\nThe Israeli air force attacked around 30 AQAH branches that night, but the branch next to Hassan’s home was spared, and he went back the next morning.\\n\\nIsrael has been hitting some of the civilian organisations linked to Hezbollah, as part of its campaign in Lebanon.\\n\\nAside from the AQAH, it has hit the Islamic Health Society (IHS), funded by Hezbollah, which operates emergency services, hospitals and medical centres across the county. It has also struck its search-and-rescue teams, killing dozens of rescue workers. Israel claims Hezbollah “is using the IHS as a cover for terrorist activities” and that those killed were carrying out military roles - but that is denied by the IHS.\\n\\nIsrael has also hit buildings housing people who had been displaced by its bombing and evacuation orders.\\n\\nSuch attacks raised widespread suspicion here in Lebanon that Israel is targeting the civilian population that is supportive of Hezbollah - widely referred to here as the ‘bi’a’ of Hezbollah, a word that translates literally as “environment”, and is taken to refer to the social base of the group.\\n\\nIt is a community made up of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese who support the party, vote for it, are employed by various civilian organisations linked to it, or are relatives of Hezbollah fighters and members.\\n\\nHezbollah’s relationship with that social base - concentrated in Shia-majority areas in the south, the eastern Bekaa valley, and the southern suburbs of Beirut – has long been considered a source of strength for the group.\\n\\nBut it has also placed it in the crosshairs of Hezbollah’s enemies.\\n\\nIsrael says AQAH finances Hezbollah’s military activities - a claim denied by the group, which says it has no role beyond offering small, interest-free loans to ordinary Lebanese, in line with Islamic law’s prohibition on charging interest.\\n\\nFollowing the strikes on AQAH branches last month, Israel’s then-defence minister said on X that Israel was “destroying the terrorist organisation’s ability to both launch and buy missiles”.\\n\\nFrom an international humanitarian law perspective, experts say AQAH is not a lawful military target regardless of Israel’s claims that it plays a role in financing Hezbollah.\\n\\n“International humanitarian law does not permit attacks on the economic or financial infrastructure of an adversary, even if they indirectly sustain its military activities,” according to Ben Saul, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-terrorism.\\n\\nMr Saul said the bombing “obliterates the distinction between civilian objects and military objectives” and “opens the door to ‘total war’ against civilian populations”.\\n\\nSo what could Israel hope to achieve by bombing civilian organisations linked to Hezbollah?\\n\\nAmal Saad, a lecturer in politics and international relations at Cardiff University and a leading expert on Hezbollah, believes the attacks are aimed at dismantling what is also known as Hezbollah’s “community of resistance.”\\n\\n“Hezbollah is probably the second biggest employer after the state,” says Ms Saad. “Its civilian institutions affect hundreds of thousands of Lebanese, mainly Shia. It’s a way of strangulating the community further.”\\n\\nIt would not be the first time Hezbollah’s social base came under attack. During the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, Israel flattened neighbourhoods in Dahieh, and two years later, revealed a military strategy drawn from that experience - what came to be known as the Dahieh Doctrine.\\n\\nIt was first articulated by then-Maj Gen Gadi Eizenkot in 2008 when he was head of the Israeli military’s Northern Command. This doctrine - as it came to be known - called for applying “disproportionate force” against civilian areas where Israel believes it is attacked from, with the goal of pressuring the people of Lebanon to turn on Hezbollah to undermine support for it.\\n\\n‘From our perspective, these are military bases…,” he said at the time. “Harming the population is the only means of restraining [Hassan] Nasrallah,\" he said, referring to the then-leader of Hezbollah. Nasrallah was killed in an air strike in Dahieh in September 2024.\\n\\nNow, Israel is striking that population in areas far removed from combat, such as Wardaniyeh, north-east of Sidon, in addition to striking Hezbollah’s network of civilian organisations.\\n\\nIn a response to the BBC, the IDF said it was “operating solely against the Hezbollah terrorist organisation, not against the Lebanese population or medical facilities, and as such takes many measures to mitigate harm to civilians”.\\n\\n“The IDF operations have been planned based on extensive intelligence gathering and in strict accordance with international law,” it added.\\n\\nAQAH is just one of several organisations linked to Hezbollah that throws lifelines to hundreds of thousands of Lebanese - especially those that form the movement’s base.\\n\\nIts story is intertwined with that of Lebanon’s financial and economic collapse.\\n\\nFounded in the early 1980s, it gave out loans to families and newly-weds, helping them meet different personal needs. More recently, the association was also beginning to offer loans for such things as agricultural projects and solar panels.\\n\\nThe US imposed sanctions on AQAH in 2007, saying it was being used by Hezbollah “as a cover to manage its financial activities”.\\n\\nIt was thrust into the spotlight again in August 2019, when the US treasury sanctioned Jammal Trust Bank, claiming, among other things, that it “knowingly facilitates the banking activities of US-designated entities openly affiliated with Hezbollah”, including AQAH. The bank was forced to close less than three weeks later.\\n\\nBut the combination of US sanctions and the collapse of Lebanon’s banking sector in October 2019 caused the association to grow like never before. As a result of sanctions on individuals and entities the US said had links to Hezbollah, Lebanese banks closed accounts of people they suspected might cause them trouble with the US treasury. Many of them took their money to AQAH.\\n\\nThen, even more people deposited money there due to the collapse of trust in the banking system - after Lebanese banks withheld people’s savings, following the financial and economic collapse in 2019.\\n\\nAQAH ended up being a support for many Lebanese who were ejected from the financial system due to US sanctions, and then for more people who had nowhere to deposit their savings following the crash.\\n\\nMany of them will be among the million or so displaced people scattered across Lebanon today - mostly from the south, the Bekaa, and Beirut’s southern suburbs.\\n\\nMany of them are crammed together in government-run shelters and empty buildings. They watch helplessly as much of their villages and cities has been decimated by the Israeli military.\\n\\nThose whose homes are still standing live in fearful anticipation of the next wave of bombing, while those with deposits with AQAH now worry that their savings are gone, in their hour of greatest need.\\n\\nThe displaced have themselves also been bombed, in areas far removed from combat zones - such as in the Christian majority northern village of Aitou, where 23 people were killed in an air strike last month - and their host communities across the country are increasingly uneasy; no-one knows when and where Israel might strike.\\n\\nMeanwhile in the south, Hezbollah and the Israeli army have been clashing directly for a month now, after Israel launched an invasion of south Lebanon in early October.\\n\\nWhichever way the fighting on the ground goes, Israel is exerting pressure on Lebanese society as a whole, through its strikes on civilian institutions like AQAH.\\n\\nSome have argued that such attacks may be part of a strategy aimed at ripping through Lebanon’s social fabric, and transforming the country into a hostile environment for Hezbollah and its “community of resistance”.', 'top_image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/98ca/live/b7907740-9754-11ef-b15b-492ffd6268a7.jpg', 'entities': [{'id':

bar facing the US embassy building in central Jerusalem is called Deja Bu - a witty reference to something you’ve drunk before.\\n\\nAnd outside the gates of the US compound, Israel is eager for a second round of Donald Trump.\\n\\n\"I\\'m very pleased,\" said Rafael Shore, a rabbi who lives in Jerusalem\\'s Old City. \"He understands the language of the Middle East.\\n\\n\"Iran will think twice about doing anything. I think if Kamala had been elected, there wouldn\\'t be much fear in the Middle East of attacking America or Israel.\"\\n\\nIsrael\\'s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was one of the first to congratulate the new president-elect on Wednesday morning. \"Congratulations on history\\'s greatest comeback!\" he tweeted.\\n\\nNetanyahu has previously called Trump the \"best friend Israel has ever had in the White House\".\\n\\nTrump previously won favour here by scrapping an Iran nuclear deal that Israel opposed, brokering historic normalisation agreements with several Arab countries and upending decades of US policy - and international consensus - by recognising Jerusalem as Israel\\'s capital.\\n\\nDonald Trump\\'s first term in office was \"exemplary\" as far as Israel is concerned, said Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the US.\\n\\n\"The hope is that he\\'ll revisit that. [But] we have to be very clear-sighted about who Donald Trump is and what he stands for.\"\\n\\nFirstly, he said, the former president \"doesn\\'t like wars\", seeing them as expensive. Trump has urged Israel to finish the war in Gaza quickly.\\n\\nHe\\'s also \"not a big fan\" of Israel\\'s settlements in the occupied West Bank, said Amb Oren, and has opposed the wishes of some Israeli leaders to annex parts of it.\\n\\nBoth those policies could put him in conflict with far-right parties in Netanyahu\\'s current governing coalition, who have threatened to bring down the government if the prime minister pursues policies they reject.\\n\\nSeven things Trump says he will do in power\\n\\nWhat Trump\\'s win means for Ukraine, Middle East and China\\n\\nWhen called upon to choose between the recent demands of his US ally and the demands of his coalition partners, Benjamin Netanyahu has tended to choose his coalition.\\n\\nFriction with the current US President, Joe Biden, has grown sharply as a result.\\n\\nMichael Oren believes Netanyahu will need to take a different approach with the incoming president.\\n\\n\"If Donald Trump comes into office in January and says, \\'OK, you have a week to finish this war,\\' Netanyahu is going to have to respect that.\"\\n\\nIn Gaza, where the Israeli military has been battling Palestinian group Hamas, desperation has narrowed the focus of some residents to that single goal.\\n\\nTrump \"has some strong promises\", Ahmed said. \"We hope he can help and bring peace.\"\\n\\nAhmed\\'s wife and son were both killed in the war and his house destroyed.\\n\\n\"Enough is enough, we are tired,\" he said. \"We hope Trump is strong so that he can resolve this issue with Israel.\"\\n\\nMohammed Dawoud, displaced eight times during the Gaza conflict, said a Trump victory meant that the end of the war would come soon.\\n\\nAnother displaced resident, Mamdouh, said he didn\\'t care who won - he just wanted someone to help.\\n\\n\"There’s no medicine, no hospitals, no food. There’s nothing left in Gaza,\" he said. \"We want someone strong who can separate us and the Jews.\"\\n\\nThe view from countries where Trump\\'s win really matters\\n\\nIn the occupied West Bank, home of the Palestinian Authority (PA), there is widespread scepticism about American influence, with many viewing US administrations from both sides of the political aisle as siding with Israel.\\n\\n\"Mediocre solutions which come at the expense of the Palestinians, or endless military support for Israel, is going to be nothing but a catalyst for future confrontations,\" said Sabri Saidam, a senior member of the PA\\'s main faction, Fatah.\\n\\n\"We would like to see a new version of Trump, more like a Trump 2.0 who\\'s serious about immediately ending the war, and addressing the root cause of conflict in the Middle East.\"\\n\\nRecent polls suggested that more than two-thirds of Israelis wanted to see Trump back in the White House. But here too, there are those who caution about his unpredictability and his approach.\\n\\nResults: Who did each state vote for?\\n\\nIn maps and charts: How small gains delivered Trump a big win\\n\\nTrump team: Who is Susie Wiles, chief of staff?\\n\\nAnalysis - Why Harris lost: Flawed candidate or doomed campaign?\\n\\n\"He\\'s going to make the situation here more uncertain and unsafe,\" one Israeli woman said. \"I don\\'t trust him to keep the peace. I honestly think he\\'ll just make the war worse.\"\\n\\nThe former Israeli ambassador, Michael Oren, said he believed there were \"tremendous achievements ahead\" if Israel co-operated with Trump, including the potential for a historic peace deal with Saudi Arabia and checks on Iran\\'s influence.\\n\\nBut it could also be harder for Netanyahu to navigate the demands and compromises involved in those regional goals.\\n\\nSince Trump\\'s last term in office, moderate voices around both leaders have dwindled.\\n\\nMany in Israel view Trump\\'s first term with fond memories. But relationships can be radically different the second time around - and past performance is no guarantee of future returns.', 'top_image':

'Israel passes law to deport relatives of attackers, including citizens', 'source': None, 'insertion_date': '2024-11-27T10:14:30.957491', 'text_content': 'The Israeli parliament has passed a law allowing the government to deport the family members of people convicted of terrorism offences, including Israeli citizens.\\n\\nThe controversial legislation, proposed by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\\'s Likud party, applies to first-degree relatives, meaning the parents, siblings or children of those found guilty of committing or supporting terrorism.\\n\\nIsraeli human rights organisations say the law is unconstitutional.\\n\\nSome opposition members of the Knesset, Israel\\'s parliament, suggested it is targeted only at Palestinian citizens of Israel, sometimes called Israeli Arabs.\\n\\nThe law allows for the deportation of the family members of those who had advance knowledge and either failed to report the matter to the police or “expressed support or identification with an act of terrorism”.\\n\\nRelatives of those who published “praise, sympathy or encouragement for an act of terrorism or a terrorist organisation” could also be deported.\\n\\nRelatives would be deported by order of the interior minister. Some members of the Knesset suggested during the debate on the bill that it would not be used against Jewish extremists, the Times of Israel website reported.\\n\\n“Yigal Amir’s family will not be deported anywhere,\" said opposition member of parliament Merav Michaeli, referring to former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin\\'s assassin, a Jewish extremist.\\n\\nMickey Levy asked “whether you will deport Ben Gvir’s family,” a reference to National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir’s conviction in his youth for incitement to violence and supporting a terror group.\\n\\nDr Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli political analyst, told the BBC there was \"no question\" the law was intended to apply to Israeli Arabs and Palestinians.\\n\\n\"It is very unlikely that a Jewish citizen of Israel would ever be deported under this law,\" Dr Scheindlin said.\\n\\n\"This is clear from certain provisions in the law itself but also important elements which will determine how the law is applied, including that in normal Israeli parlance, the term \\'terror\\' is almost never applied to Jewish acts of violence against Palestinian civilians.\"\\n\\nAbout 20% of the country\\'s population are Palestinian citizens of Israel.\\n\\nA truck which hit a bus stop in central Israel last month, killing one and injuring dozens, was driven by a man identified by authorities as a Palestinian citizen of Israel.\\n\\nMany Israeli Arabs have also been convicted for posting support or sympathy for Hamas on social media since 7 October last year.\\n\\nBoth the justice ministry and the attorney general’s office have raised concerns about how the legislation, which will likely be challenged in court, can be enforced.', 'top_image':

'2024-11-26T23:00:12.795820', 'text_content': \"Easy-fit prosthetics offer hope to thousands of Gaza amputees\\n\\nStanding between two bars erected at a mobile clinic in Rafah, southern Gaza, Rizeq Tafish concentrates as he takes his first tentative steps in four months.\\n\\n“My feelings before were sadness and despair. Now I feel happiness and freedom,” he says, grinning afterwards.\\n\\nRizeq is one of the first of thousands of wounded Palestinians who should receive new prosthetic limbs from Jordanian doctors using state-of-the-art British technology.\\n\\nWarning: This report contains graphic details of injuries\\n\\nDisplaced to Rafah, he was wounded by Israeli tank fire as he left Friday prayers in June. With his leg amputated, the blacksmith could no longer work and was feeling desperate.\\n\\n“I lost my whole life: my job and my hope,” Rizeq says. “There was no one to take care of my wife and baby. I even needed help to use the toilet.”\\n\\nThe human cost of Israel’s destructive year-long war in Gaza is measured not just in lives lost but in lives changed forever.\\n\\nAfter analysing emergency medical data, the UN’s World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that at least 94,000 people are injured. More than 24,000 people – one in every 100 Gazans – have a life-changing injury. These include serious burns, trauma to the head and spine and limb amputations.\\n\\nAt the same time, it has become virtually impossible to leave Gaza for medical treatment and only 16 out of 36 hospitals are functional. Rehabilitation services are heavily disrupted. The WHO says just 12% of equipment needed for injured people - such as wheelchairs and crutches - is available.\\n\\nThe Jordanian programme uses innovative prosthetics from two British firms, Koalaa and Amparo. They have easy-to-fit sockets and a new direct moulding technique for lower limbs, which avoid months of waiting and multiple fittings.\\n\\n“This is a new type of prosthesis. Its main feature is fast manufacture. It means it will be ready for the patient within only one to two hours,” explains Jordanian army doctor, Lt Abdullah Al-Hemaida, who has deftly fitted Rizeq with his replacement leg.\\n\\nHis medical team has already helped dozens of amputees. Each prosthetic limb costs about $1,400 (£1,100), with funding from the Jordanian state and a national charity.\\n\\nEvery fitting is registered digitally allowing for remote monitoring and follow-up procedures.\\n\\nIf it is safe enough, the plan is for two Jordanian mobile units to move around. There is a huge need for prosthetics across all of Gaza among all age groups.\\n\\nAt the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in central Gaza, sisters Hanan and Misk al-Doubri are so small that they fit in one wheelchair. Last month, they lost their mother and their legs in an Israeli air strike on their home in Deir al-Balah.\\n\\nMisk, who is 18 months old, had just learned to walk. Now she struggles to stand on her one good foot. But Hanan, who is three, has much more severe injuries; she was blasted out of her family’s first-floor apartment.\\n\\n“We try to distract her, but she always returns to asking about her mum,” her aunt, Sheifa says. “Then she asks, ‘Where are my legs?’ I don’t know what to tell her.”\\n\\nI asked the Israeli military why the al-Doubris were targeted but received no response.\\n\\nLocals believe the girls’ father, a policeman, who remains in intensive care, may have been targeted. Israel has attacked many people who worked for the security forces in Hamas-governed Gaza.\\n\\nWith Israeli drones overhead, 15-year-old Diya al-Adini surveys the destruction by his home in Deir al-Balah. Around his neck he always wears his prized possession, bought with months of savings: a digital camera.\\n\\nHowever, he can no longer use it unaided: he has no arms.\\n\\nIn August, Diya was playing a computer game in a coffee shop when Israel bombed it.\\n\\n“The speed of the rocket made it hard for me to react. After it hit, I lost consciousness for a few seconds,” Diya recalls. “When I came to, everything was white. It felt like I was watching a movie. I tried to get up, but I couldn't move at all; I didn't have any hands to help me.”\\n\\nDiya used to love swimming and walking his dogs, he did errands on his bicycle and photographed landscapes. Now he relies on his older sister, Aya, to take photos for him. But he is determined to be positive.\\n\\n“I am trying to plan a good future so that after I get prosthetics, I can work hard and excel to become a famous photographer,” he says. “I need my limbs to return to my photography, and to everything I loved.”\\n\\nMaking his way on the uneven path to the tent camp that he now calls home, Rizeq Tafish has been given crutches to help him adjust to his new prosthetic leg.\\n\\n“I want to forget the period when I was without my legs and start again. I still consider myself to be whole and complete,” he tells a local journalist working for the BBC in Gaza.\\n\\n“I could go back to my job or get a different one now that I have my new limb. Just getting my leg back is also giving me back my smile that I want to share with everyone.”\\n\\nBut there are tears of joy as well as smiles when he reaches his family. Rizeq’s mother is overcome as he walks forward without any help to embrace her and his wife praises God as he stands holding their little boy.\\n\\nRizeq is just one among many in Gaza learning to cope with a new serious disability but he has taken a step towards getting back his life.\", 'top_image':

'text_content': 'Protests have erupted in Israel after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired the country\\'s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.\\n\\nNetanyahu said a \"crisis of trust\" between the two leaders led to his decision, adding that his trust in Gallant had \"eroded\" in recent months and Foreign Minister Israel Katz would step in to replace him.\\n\\nGallant said his removal was due to disagreement on three issues, including his belief that it is possible to get the remaining hostages back from Gaza if Israel makes \"painful concessions\" which it \"can bear\".\\n\\nMany protesters on the streets were calling for Netanyahu to resign, and demanding the new defence minister prioritise a hostage deal.\\n\\nNetanyahu and Gallant have long had a divisive working relationship. During the past year, there have been reports of shouting matches between the two men over Israel’s war strategy.\\n\\nThe former defence minister has also been unhappy at plans to continue to allow Israel’s Ultra Orthodox citizens to be exempt from serving in the military.\\n\\nMonths before the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, Netanyahu had fired Gallant over political differences, before reinstating him following major public outcry.\\n\\nBut on Tuesday Netanyahu said: \"In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and the minister of defence\".\\n\\nHe said although there had been trust and \"fruitful work\" in the first months of the war, \"during the last months this trust cracked\".\\n\\nNetanyahu added that \"significant gaps were discovered between me and Gallant in the management of the campaign\".\\n\\nThese were \"accompanied by statements and actions that contradict the decisions of the government,\" he added.\\n\\nFollowing the news, Gallant posted on social media that the \"security of the state of Israel was and will always remain the mission of my life\".\\n\\nHe later released a full statement on Tuesday night saying his removal from office had been \"the result of disagreement on three issues\".\\n\\nHe believed there should be no exceptions for military service, that a national inquiry was needed to learn lessons, and the hostages should be brought back as soon as possible.\\n\\nIn reference to the hostages, he said: \"I determine that it is possible to achieve this goal. It requires painful concessions, which the state of Israel can carry and the IDF can bear.\"\\n\\nOne of those protesting following the announcement, Yair Amit, said Netanyahu is endangering the whole country and called on the prime minister to \"step down from his office and to let serious people lead Israel\".\\n\\nHis replacement Katz is seen as even more hawkish in terms of military strategy.\\n\\nAnother Netanyahu ally, Gideon Sa\\'ar - who previously held no cabinet portfolio- will become the new foreign minister.\\n\\nGallant\\'s removal will come into effect in 48 hours. The appointment of the new ministers requires the approval of the government and then the Knesset.\\n\\nNetanyahu first fired Gallant in March 2023 following their disagreement over controversial plans to overhaul the justice system.\\n\\nBut he was forced to retract the sacking following massive public protests in several cities in Israel - an event that became known as \"Gallant Night.\"\\n\\nIn May this year, Gallant voiced open frustration at the government’s failure to address the question of a post-war plan for Gaza. Gallant wanted Netanyahu to declare publicly that Israel has no plans to take over civilian and military rule in Gaza.\\n\\nIt was a rare public sign of divisions within Israel\\'s war cabinet over the direction of the military campaign.\\n\\n“Since October, I have been raising this issue consistently in the cabinet,” Gallant said, “and have received no response\".\\n\\nNetanyahu responded by saying that he was \"not ready to exchange Hamastan for Fatahstan,\" in reference to rival Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah.\\n\\nResponding to Gallant\\'s removal on Tuesday night, members of Israel\\'s political opposition parties called for protests from the public.\\n\\nGallant’s dismissal also takes place on the day of the presidential election in the US- Israel’s key backer in its war in Gaza - a timing noted by several Israeli media outlets.\\n\\nGallant was viewed as having a much better relationship with the White House than Netanyahu.\\n\\nA representative for the White House\\'s National Security Council said on Tuesday: \"Minister Gallant has been an important partner on all matters related to the defence of Israel. As close partners, we will continue to work collaboratively with Israel’s next minister of defence.\"\\n\\nObservers note that Gallant\\'s removal also comes at a time where Netanyahu is under pressure by far-right politicians to pass a bill which would have continued to allow Israel\\'s ultra-Orthodox citizens to be exempt from serving in the military. Gallant had been a high-profile opponent of the bill.', 'top_image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7585/live/6d66ce70-9bd8-11ef-9c84-915bca93aa53.jpg', 'entities': [{'id':

his predecessor.\\n\\nIn an unprecedented political drama that has gripped the nation Rigathi Gachagua was removed from office two weeks ago after parliament overwhelmingly approved an impeachment motion.\\n\\nPresident William Ruto immediately nominated Kindiki, currently the interior minister, to replace Gachagua.\\n\\nBut the impeached deputy president then went to court objecting to his removal calling it politically motivated.\\n\\nParliament had approved Kindiki\\'s appointment but a court put his swearing-in on hold pending the legal challenges from Gachagua and others.\\n\\nOn Thursday, a panel of three judges removed the orders preventing Kindiki\\'s swearing-in, ruling that an extended vacancy in the office of deputy president was \"untenable\".\\n\\nThe court cited the need for continuity in the office of the second-in-command in the country.\\n\\n\"Public interest demands that the office of the deputy president should not remain vacant,\" Justice Anthony Mrima ruled.\\n\\nGachagua\\'s lawyers say they will appeal against the judges\\' ruling.\\n\\nBut the court also said that the case challenging Gachagua\\'s impeachment itself can continue.\\n\\nDuring the impeachment, lawmakers upheld charges against Gachagua including inciting ethnic divisions and violating his oath of office.\\n\\nHis several attempts to scuttle the impeachment process were dismissed by the judges but he vowed to fight his removal in court.\\n\\nThe 59-year-old was impeached while he was in hospital.\\n\\nHe argued that he was denied the right to fair hearing, adding that charges against him were not substantiated.\\n\\nGachagua, popularly known as Riggy G, is wealthy businessman from the vote-rich central Mount Kenya region, which overwhelmingly voted for Ruto in 2022 election.\\n\\nHe is the first deputy president to be impeached under Kenya\\'s revised 2010 constitution.\\n\\nKindiki, a 52-year-old former law professor who is also from the Mount Kenya region, had

The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office determined he died by suicide.\\n\\nThe Kobayashi family said the “devastating tragedy” only adds to their anguish.\\n\\n“After tirelessly searching throughout Los Angeles for 13 days, Hannah’s father, Ryan Kobayashi, tragically took his own life. This loss has compounded the family’s suffering immeasurably,” the family said in a statement released through a nonprofit group helping with the search.\\n\\nAs the search for Hannah continues, here’s what we know:\\n\\nA planned trip to New York\\n\\nHannah had plans to spend time with an aunt in upstate New York earlier this month.\\n\\nOn November 8, she took a flight from Maui to Los Angeles. She was supposed to take a connecting flight from Los Angeles International Airport to John F. Kennedy International Airport the same day but did not board, her sister, Sydni, previously told CNN.\\n\\nHannah had the same itinerary as an ex-boyfriend. The pair decided to keep their flights since they could not get a refund but would be going their separate ways once they landed in New York, Sydni said.\\n\\nThe next day, Hannah was spotted at a Taschen bookstore at The Grove shopping center in Los Angeles, her sister said, and it is unclear why she was there. Hannah then sent a Venmo payment to two people whose names the family does not recognize, Sydni said.\\n\\nOn Sunday, November 10, a video was posted on YouTube showing Hannah at the LeBron XXII Trial Experience, an event held at the Nike store in the same shopping center. A photo of the event was also posted on her Instagram account, her sister said.\\n\\nOn November 11 – the last day anyone heard from the missing woman – her mother texted her, asking whether she made it to New York. Hannah responded no, her sister said. Hannah also sent messages to a friend saying she did not feel safe, and someone was trying to steal her identity and money, according to screenshots her sister sent to CNN.\\n\\n“Deep Hackers wiped my identity, stole all of my funds, & have had me on a mind f**k since Friday,” one message to a friend said.\\n\\nAnother message said, “I got tricked pretty much into giving away all my funds,” followed by one saying, “For someone I thought I loved.”\\n\\nOn November 15, the Los Angeles Police Department’s missing persons unit made a poster about Hannah’s disappearance, saying she was last seen at the airport. It said she has freckles on her face and a tattoo on her forearm.\\n\\nIn a statement posted to Facebook on November 17, Sydni said the family had obtained surveillance footage showing her sister around the downtown Metro train station near Crypto.com Arena, although it was unclear exactly when the footage was taken.\\n\\nIn the footage, Hannah is not alone and “does not appear to be in good condition,” the family wrote, saying they are unable to share further details.\\n\\n‘Ryan died of a broken heart’\\n\\nHannah’s father Ryan traveled to Los Angeles not long after his daughter’s disappearance to help look for her.\\n\\n“Hannah loved to travel. She loved photography, art, music. I wasn’t too close with her … growing up. We haven’t had contact for a while,” the elder Kobayashi told CNN’s Veronica Miracle in an interview last week. “I’m just trying to make up. I’m trying to get her back. That’s my main focus.”\\n\\nBut after searching for his 30-year-old daughter for nearly two weeks, he was found dead, according to a family statement.\\n\\nHannah’s aunt, Larie Pidgeon, briefly spoke with CNN about Ryan’s death.\\n\\n“As you can imagine the family is devastated,” Pidgeon said on Monday. “We also want to make it clear that Ryan died of a broken heart.”\\n\\nA newly released statement Monday from the family said they are “overwhelmed by the immense outpouring of love and support” during this time.\\n\\n“The loss of Ryan has been a heartbreaking tragedy for all of us, and we are forever grateful for the compassion and strength you have shown. As we navigate the unimaginable grief, we are holding onto hope and turning to our community for help,” the statement said.\\n\\n“The search for our beloved Hannah must continue with the same love and determination that Ryan would have wanted. We need your help, we need your strength. Our family needs you. The search for our dear Hannah must continue with unwavering hope and determination. She is still out there, and we believe that together, we can bring her home,” it continued.\\n\\nA GoFundMe page has been set up to support Ryan’s fiancée “during this unimaginable time.”\\n\\nCNN’s

For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,” Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.\\n\\n“That is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,” he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.\\n\\nThe apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.\\n\\nThe industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world’s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish – or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.\\n\\nAlchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.\\n\\nCalled Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.\\n\\nEndeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine’s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.\\n\\n“What we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,” says Dr Hudd.\\n\\nAlchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.\\n\\nDeveloped initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.\\n\\n“The UK, they’re really strong in R&D projects, they’re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,” says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.\\n\\nAlchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.\\n\\nThere’s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a “digital spray application” with similar environmental benefits.\\n\\nNTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC’s interview request.\\n\\nKirsi Niinimäki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland’s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look “quite promising” – although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.\\n\\nBut even though it's early days, Ms Niinimäki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.\\n\\n“All these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you’re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals – so that of course is a huge improvement.”\\n\\nBack in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out – like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.\\n\\nAlchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment – an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.\\n\\nThe company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.\\n\\nThey will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.\\n\\nBig fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.\\n\\nAnd that’s just one company - there will be many, many more in need.\", 'top_image':

      "        \"text_content\": \"When Israel declared last month that it would target a Hezbollah-linked Lebanese microloan charity it triggered a frenzied search for a list of the organisation\\u2019s branches.\\n\\nPeople across the country tried to figure out whether they needed to flee their homes where the branches were located before Israel started bombing.\\n\\nAl-Qard Al-Hassan Association (AQAH), a charity that offers interest-free microloans, had grown in prominence over the past decade amid US sanctions and the collapse of Lebanon\\u2019s banking sector.\\n\\nHassan lives with his family in Beirut, 200m (655ft) away from a branch of AQAH.\\n\\n\\u201cWe heard about it from this guy Avichay,\\u201d he said, referring to Avichay Adraee, a spokesman in Arabic for the Israeli army who announces evacuation orders on social media.\\n\\n\\u201cThen the bombing started in [the southern Beirut suburb of] Dahieh. We could hear it: \\u2018Boom, boom, boom.\\u2019 The kids jump at every \\u2018boom\\u2019.\\u201d\\n\\nWith nowhere else to go, Hassan took his family to the seaside, where they spent a sleepless night squeezed together in the car.\\n\\nThe Israeli air force attacked around 30 AQAH branches that night, but the branch next to Hassan\\u2019s home was spared, and he went back the next morning.\\n\\nIsrael has been hitting some of the civilian organisations linked to Hezbollah, as part of its campaign in Lebanon.\\n\\nAside from the AQAH, it has hit the Islamic Health Society (IHS), funded by Hezbollah, which operates emergency services, hospitals and medical centres across the county. It has also struck its search-and-rescue teams, killing dozens of rescue workers. Israel claims Hezbollah \\u201cis using the IHS as a cover for terrorist activities\\u201d and that those killed were carrying out military roles - but that is denied by the IHS.\\n\\nIsrael has also hit buildings housing people who had been displaced by its bombing and evacuation orders.\\n\\nSuch attacks raised widespread suspicion here in Lebanon that Israel is targeting the civilian population that is supportive of Hezbollah - widely referred to here as the \\u2018bi\\u2019a\\u2019 of Hezbollah, a word that translates literally as \\u201cenvironment\\u201d, and is taken to refer to the social base of the group.\\n\\nIt is a community made up of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese who support the party, vote for it, are employed by various civilian organisations linked to it, or are relatives of Hezbollah fighters and members.\\n\\nHezbollah\\u2019s relationship with that social base - concentrated in Shia-majority areas in the south, the eastern Bekaa valley, and the southern suburbs of Beirut \\u2013 has long been considered a source of strength for the group.\\n\\nBut it has also placed it in the crosshairs of Hezbollah\\u2019s enemies.\\n\\nIsrael says AQAH finances Hezbollah\\u2019s military activities - a claim denied by the group, which says it has no role beyond offering small, interest-free loans to ordinary Lebanese, in line with Islamic law\\u2019s prohibition on charging interest.\\n\\nFollowing the strikes on AQAH branches last month, Israel\\u2019s then-defence minister said on X that Israel was \\u201cdestroying the terrorist organisation\\u2019s ability to both launch and buy missiles\\u201d.\\n\\nFrom an international humanitarian law perspective, experts say AQAH is not a lawful military target regardless of Israel\\u2019s claims that it plays a role in financing Hezbollah.\\n\\n\\u201cInternational humanitarian law does not permit attacks on the economic or financial infrastructure of an adversary, even if they indirectly sustain its military activities,\\u201d according to Ben Saul, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-terrorism.\\n\\nMr Saul said the bombing \\u201cobliterates the distinction between civilian objects and military objectives\\u201d and \\u201copens the door to \\u2018total war\\u2019 against civilian populations\\u201d.\\n\\nSo what could Israel hope to achieve by bombing civilian organisations linked to Hezbollah?\\n\\nAmal Saad, a lecturer in politics and international relations at Cardiff University and a leading expert on Hezbollah, believes the attacks are aimed at dismantling what is also known as Hezbollah\\u2019s \\u201ccommunity of resistance.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHezbollah is probably the second biggest employer after the state,\\u201d says Ms Saad. \\u201cIts civilian institutions affect hundreds of thousands of Lebanese, mainly Shia. It\\u2019s a way of strangulating the community further.\\u201d\\n\\nIt would not be the first time Hezbollah\\u2019s social base came under attack. During the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, Israel flattened neighbourhoods in Dahieh, and two years later, revealed a military strategy drawn from that experience - what came to be known as the Dahieh Doctrine.\\n\\nIt was first articulated by then-Maj Gen Gadi Eizenkot in 2008 when he was head of the Israeli military\\u2019s Northern Command. This doctrine - as it came to be known - called for applying \\u201cdisproportionate force\\u201d against civilian areas where Israel believes it is attacked from, with the goal of pressuring the people of Lebanon to turn on Hezbollah to undermine support for it.\\n\\n\\u2018From our perspective, these are military bases\\u2026,\\u201d he said at the time. \\u201cHarming the population is the only means of restraining [Hassan] Nasrallah,\\\" he said, referring to the then-leader of Hezbollah. Nasrallah was killed in an air strike in Dahieh in September 2024.\\n\\nNow, Israel is striking that population in areas far removed from combat, such as Wardaniyeh, north-east of Sidon, in addition to striking Hezbollah\\u2019s network of civilian organisations.\\n\\nIn a response to the BBC, the IDF said it was \\u201coperating solely against the Hezbollah terrorist organisation, not against the Lebanese population or medical facilities, and as such takes many measures to mitigate harm to civilians\\u201d.\\n\\n\\u201cThe IDF operations have been planned based on extensive intelligence gathering and in strict accordance with international law,\\u201d it added.\\n\\nAQAH is just one of several organisations linked to Hezbollah that throws lifelines to hundreds of thousands of Lebanese - especially those that form the movement\\u2019s base.\\n\\nIts story is intertwined with that of Lebanon\\u2019s financial and economic collapse.\\n\\nFounded in the early 1980s, it gave out loans to families and newly-weds, helping them meet different personal needs. More recently, the association was also beginning to offer loans for such things as agricultural projects and solar panels.\\n\\nThe US imposed sanctions on AQAH in 2007, saying it was being used by Hezbollah \\u201cas a cover to manage its financial activities\\u201d.\\n\\nIt was thrust into the spotlight again in August 2019, when the US treasury sanctioned Jammal Trust Bank, claiming, among other things, that it \\u201cknowingly facilitates the banking activities of US-designated entities openly affiliated with Hezbollah\\u201d, including AQAH. The bank was forced to close less than three weeks later.\\n\\nBut the combination of US sanctions and the collapse of Lebanon\\u2019s banking sector in October 2019 caused the association to grow like never before. As a result of sanctions on individuals and entities the US said had links to Hezbollah, Lebanese banks closed accounts of people they suspected might cause them trouble with the US treasury. Many of them took their money to AQAH.\\n\\nThen, even more people deposited money there due to the collapse of trust in the banking system - after Lebanese banks withheld people\\u2019s savings, following the financial and economic collapse in 2019.\\n\\nAQAH ended up being a support for many Lebanese who were ejected from the financial system due to US sanctions, and then for more people who had nowhere to deposit their savings following the crash.\\n\\nMany of them will be among the million or so displaced people scattered across Lebanon today - mostly from the south, the Bekaa, and Beirut\\u2019s southern suburbs.\\n\\nMany of them are crammed together in government-run shelters and empty buildings. They watch helplessly as much of their villages and cities has been decimated by the Israeli military.\\n\\nThose whose homes are still standing live in fearful anticipation of the next wave of bombing, while those with deposits with AQAH now worry that their savings are gone, in their hour of greatest need.\\n\\nThe displaced have themselves also been bombed, in areas far removed from combat zones - such as in the Christian majority northern village of Aitou, where 23 people were killed in an air strike last month - and their host communities across the country are increasingly uneasy; no-one knows when and where Israel might strike.\\n\\nMeanwhile in the south, Hezbollah and the Israeli army have been clashing directly for a month now, after Israel launched an invasion of south Lebanon in early October.\\n\\nWhichever way the fighting on the ground goes, Israel is exerting pressure on Lebanese society as a whole, through its strikes on civilian institutions like AQAH.\\n\\nSome have argued that such attacks may be part of a strategy aimed at ripping through Lebanon\\u2019s social fabric, and transforming the country into a hostile environment for Hezbollah and its \\u201ccommunity of resistance\\u201d.\",\n",

I think if Kamala had been elected, there wouldn't be much fear in the Middle East of attacking America or Israel.\\\"\\n\\nIsrael's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was one of the first to congratulate the new president-elect on Wednesday morning. \\\"Congratulations on history's greatest comeback!\\\" he tweeted.\\n\\nNetanyahu has previously called Trump the \\\"best friend Israel has ever had in the White House\\\".\\n\\nTrump previously won favour here by scrapping an Iran nuclear deal that Israel opposed, brokering historic normalisation agreements with several Arab countries and upending decades of US policy - and international consensus - by recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\\n\\nDonald Trump's first term in office was \\\"exemplary\\\" as far as Israel is concerned, said Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the US.\\n\\n\\\"The hope is that he'll revisit that. [But] we have to be very clear-sighted about who Donald Trump is and what he stands for.\\\"\\n\\nFirstly, he said, the former president \\\"doesn't like wars\\\", seeing them as expensive. Trump has urged Israel to finish the war in Gaza quickly.\\n\\nHe's also \\\"not a big fan\\\" of Israel's settlements in the occupied West Bank, said Amb Oren, and has opposed the wishes of some Israeli leaders to annex parts of it.\\n\\nBoth those policies could put him in conflict with far-right parties in Netanyahu's current governing coalition, who have threatened to bring down the government if the prime minister pursues policies they reject.\\n\\nSeven things Trump says he will do in power\\n\\nWhat Trump's win means for Ukraine, Middle East and China\\n\\nWhen called upon to choose between the recent demands of his US ally and the demands of his coalition partners, Benjamin Netanyahu has tended to choose his coalition.\\n\\nFriction with the current US President, Joe Biden, has grown sharply as a result.\\n\\nMichael Oren believes Netanyahu will need to take a different approach with the incoming president.\\n\\n\\\"If Donald Trump comes into office in January and says, 'OK, you have a week to finish this war,' Netanyahu is going to have to respect that.\\\"\\n\\nIn Gaza, where the Israeli military has been battling Palestinian group Hamas, desperation has narrowed the focus of some residents to that single goal.\\n\\nTrump \\\"has some strong promises\\\", Ahmed said. \\\"We hope he can help and bring peace.\\\"\\n\\nAhmed's wife and son were both killed in the war and his house destroyed.\\n\\n\\\"Enough is enough, we are tired,\\\" he said. \\\"We hope Trump is strong so that he can resolve this issue with Israel.\\\"\\n\\nMohammed Dawoud, displaced eight times during the Gaza conflict, said a Trump victory meant that the end of the war would come soon.\\n\\nAnother displaced resident, Mamdouh, said he didn't care who won - he just wanted someone to help.\\n\\n\\\"There\\u2019s no medicine, no hospitals, no food. There\\u2019s nothing left in Gaza,\\\" he said. \\\"We want someone strong who can separate us and the Jews.\\\"\\n\\nThe view from countries where Trump's win really matters\\n\\nIn the occupied West Bank, home of the Palestinian Authority (PA), there is widespread scepticism about American influence, with many viewing US administrations from both sides of the political aisle as siding with Israel.\\n\\n\\\"Mediocre solutions which come at the expense of the Palestinians, or endless military support for Israel, is going to be nothing but a catalyst for future confrontations,\\\" said Sabri Saidam, a senior member of the PA's main faction, Fatah.\\n\\n\\\"We would like to see a new version of Trump, more like a Trump 2.0 who's serious about immediately ending the war, and addressing the root cause of conflict in the Middle East.\\\"\\n\\nRecent polls suggested that more than two-thirds of Israelis wanted to see Trump back in the White House. But here too, there are those who caution about his unpredictability and his approach.\\n\\nResults: Who did each state vote for?\\n\\nIn maps and charts: How small gains delivered Trump a big win\\n\\nTrump team: Who is Susie Wiles, chief of staff?\\n\\nAnalysis - Why Harris lost: Flawed candidate or doomed campaign?\\n\\n\\\"He's going to make the situation here more uncertain and unsafe,\\\" one Israeli woman said. \\\"I don't trust him to keep the peace. I honestly think he'll just make the war worse.\\\"\\n\\nThe former Israeli ambassador, Michael Oren, said he believed there were \\\"tremendous achievements ahead\\\" if Israel co-operated with Trump, including the potential for a historic peace deal with Saudi Arabia and checks on Iran's influence.\\n\\nBut it could also be harder for Netanyahu to navigate the demands and compromises involved in those regional goals.\\n\\nSince Trump's last term in office, moderate voices around both leaders have dwindled.\\n\\nMany in Israel view Trump's first term with fond memories. But relationships can be radically different the second time around - and past performance is no guarantee of future returns.\",\n",

Some members of the Knesset suggested during the debate on the bill that it would not be used against Jewish extremists, the Times of Israel website reported.\\n\\n\\u201cYigal Amir\\u2019s family will not be deported anywhere,\\\" said opposition member of parliament Merav Michaeli, referring to former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassin, a Jewish extremist.\\n\\nMickey Levy asked \\u201cwhether you will deport Ben Gvir\\u2019s family,\\u201d a reference to National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir\\u2019s conviction in his youth for incitement to violence and supporting a terror group.\\n\\nDr Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli political analyst, told the BBC there was \\\"no question\\\" the law was intended to apply to Israeli Arabs and Palestinians.\\n\\n\\\"It is very unlikely that a Jewish citizen of Israel would ever be deported under this law,\\\" Dr Scheindlin said.\\n\\n\\\"This is clear from certain provisions in the law itself but also important elements which will determine how the law is applied, including that in normal Israeli parlance, the term 'terror' is almost never applied to Jewish acts of violence against Palestinian civilians.\\\"\\n\\nAbout 20% of the country's population are Palestinian citizens of Israel.\\n\\nA truck which hit a bus stop in central Israel last month, killing one and injuring dozens, was driven by a man identified by authorities as a Palestinian citizen of Israel.\\n\\nMany Israeli Arabs have also been convicted for posting support or sympathy for Hamas on social media since 7 October last year.\\n\\nBoth the justice ministry and the attorney general\\u2019s office have raised concerns about how the legislation, which will likely be challenged in court, can be enforced.\",\n",

      "        \"text_content\": \"Easy-fit prosthetics offer hope to thousands of Gaza amputees\\n\\nStanding between two bars erected at a mobile clinic in Rafah, southern Gaza, Rizeq Tafish concentrates as he takes his first tentative steps in four months.\\n\\n\\u201cMy feelings before were sadness and despair. Now I feel happiness and freedom,\\u201d he says, grinning afterwards.\\n\\nRizeq is one of the first of thousands of wounded Palestinians who should receive new prosthetic limbs from Jordanian doctors using state-of-the-art British technology.\\n\\nWarning: This report contains graphic details of injuries\\n\\nDisplaced to Rafah, he was wounded by Israeli tank fire as he left Friday prayers in June. With his leg amputated, the blacksmith could no longer work and was feeling desperate.\\n\\n\\u201cI lost my whole life: my job and my hope,\\u201d Rizeq says. \\u201cThere was no one to take care of my wife and baby. I even needed help to use the toilet.\\u201d\\n\\nThe human cost of Israel\\u2019s destructive year-long war in Gaza is measured not just in lives lost but in lives changed forever.\\n\\nAfter analysing emergency medical data, the UN\\u2019s World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that at least 94,000 people are injured. More than 24,000 people \\u2013 one in every 100 Gazans \\u2013 have a life-changing injury. These include serious burns, trauma to the head and spine and limb amputations.\\n\\nAt the same time, it has become virtually impossible to leave Gaza for medical treatment and only 16 out of 36 hospitals are functional. Rehabilitation services are heavily disrupted. The WHO says just 12% of equipment needed for injured people - such as wheelchairs and crutches - is available.\\n\\nThe Jordanian programme uses innovative prosthetics from two British firms, Koalaa and Amparo. They have easy-to-fit sockets and a new direct moulding technique for lower limbs, which avoid months of waiting and multiple fittings.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is a new type of prosthesis. Its main feature is fast manufacture. It means it will be ready for the patient within only one to two hours,\\u201d explains Jordanian army doctor, Lt Abdullah Al-Hemaida, who has deftly fitted Rizeq with his replacement leg.\\n\\nHis medical team has already helped dozens of amputees. Each prosthetic limb costs about $1,400 (\\u00a31,100), with funding from the Jordanian state and a national charity.\\n\\nEvery fitting is registered digitally allowing for remote monitoring and follow-up procedures.\\n\\nIf it is safe enough, the plan is for two Jordanian mobile units to move around. There is a huge need for prosthetics across all of Gaza among all age groups.\\n\\nAt the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in central Gaza, sisters Hanan and Misk al-Doubri are so small that they fit in one wheelchair. Last month, they lost their mother and their legs in an Israeli air strike on their home in Deir al-Balah.\\n\\nMisk, who is 18 months old, had just learned to walk. Now she struggles to stand on her one good foot. But Hanan, who is three, has much more severe injuries; she was blasted out of her family\\u2019s first-floor apartment.\\n\\n\\u201cWe try to distract her, but she always returns to asking about her mum,\\u201d her aunt, Sheifa says. \\u201cThen she asks, \\u2018Where are my legs?\\u2019 I don\\u2019t know what to tell her.\\u201d\\n\\nI asked the Israeli military why the al-Doubris were targeted but received no response.\\n\\nLocals believe the girls\\u2019 father, a policeman, who remains in intensive care, may have been targeted. Israel has attacked many people who worked for the security forces in Hamas-governed Gaza.\\n\\nWith Israeli drones overhead, 15-year-old Diya al-Adini surveys the destruction by his home in Deir al-Balah. Around his neck he always wears his prized possession, bought with months of savings: a digital camera.\\n\\nHowever, he can no longer use it unaided: he has no arms.\\n\\nIn August, Diya was playing a computer game in a coffee shop when Israel bombed it.\\n\\n\\u201cThe speed of the rocket made it hard for me to react. After it hit, I lost consciousness for a few seconds,\\u201d Diya recalls. \\u201cWhen I came to, everything was white. It felt like I was watching a movie. I tried to get up, but I couldn't move at all; I didn't have any hands to help me.\\u201d\\n\\nDiya used to love swimming and walking his dogs, he did errands on his bicycle and photographed landscapes. Now he relies on his older sister, Aya, to take photos for him. But he is determined to be positive.\\n\\n\\u201cI am trying to plan a good future so that after I get prosthetics, I can work hard and excel to become a famous photographer,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI need my limbs to return to my photography, and to everything I loved.\\u201d\\n\\nMaking his way on the uneven path to the tent camp that he now calls home, Rizeq Tafish has been given crutches to help him adjust to his new prosthetic leg.\\n\\n\\u201cI want to forget the period when I was without my legs and start again. I still consider myself to be whole and complete,\\u201d he tells a local journalist working for the BBC in Gaza.\\n\\n\\u201cI could go back to my job or get a different one now that I have my new limb. Just getting my leg back is also giving me back my smile that I want to share with everyone.\\u201d\\n\\nBut there are tears of joy as well as smiles when he reaches his family. Rizeq\\u2019s mother is overcome as he walks forward without any help to embrace her and his wife praises God as he stands holding their little boy.\\n\\nRizeq is just one among many in Gaza learning to cope with a new serious disability but he has taken a step towards getting back his life.\",\n",

      "        \"text_content\": \"Protests have erupted in Israel after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired the country's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.\\n\\nNetanyahu said a \\\"crisis of trust\\\" between the two leaders led to his decision, adding that his trust in Gallant had \\\"eroded\\\" in recent months and Foreign Minister Israel Katz would step in to replace him.\\n\\nGallant said his removal was due to disagreement on three issues, including his belief that it is possible to get the remaining hostages back from Gaza if Israel makes \\\"painful concessions\\\" which it \\\"can bear\\\".\\n\\nMany protesters on the streets were calling for Netanyahu to resign, and demanding the new defence minister prioritise a hostage deal.\\n\\nNetanyahu and Gallant have long had a divisive working relationship. During the past year, there have been reports of shouting matches between the two men over Israel\\u2019s war strategy.\\n\\nThe former defence minister has also been unhappy at plans to continue to allow Israel\\u2019s Ultra Orthodox citizens to be exempt from serving in the military.\\n\\nMonths before the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, Netanyahu had fired Gallant over political differences, before reinstating him following major public outcry.\\n\\nBut on Tuesday Netanyahu said: \\\"In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and the minister of defence\\\".\\n\\nHe said although there had been trust and \\\"fruitful work\\\" in the first months of the war, \\\"during the last months this trust cracked\\\".\\n\\nNetanyahu added that \\\"significant gaps were discovered between me and Gallant in the management of the campaign\\\".\\n\\nThese were \\\"accompanied by statements and actions that contradict the decisions of the government,\\\" he added.\\n\\nFollowing the news, Gallant posted on social media that the \\\"security of the state of Israel was and will always remain the mission of my life\\\".\\n\\nHe later released a full statement on Tuesday night saying his removal from office had been \\\"the result of disagreement on three issues\\\".\\n\\nHe believed there should be no exceptions for military service, that a national inquiry was needed to learn lessons, and the hostages should be brought back as soon as possible.\\n\\nIn reference to the hostages, he said: \\\"I determine that it is possible to achieve this goal. It requires painful concessions, which the state of Israel can carry and the IDF can bear.\\\"\\n\\nOne of those protesting following the announcement, Yair Amit, said Netanyahu is endangering the whole country and called on the prime minister to \\\"step down from his office and to let serious people lead Israel\\\".\\n\\nHis replacement Katz is seen as even more hawkish in terms of military strategy.\\n\\nAnother Netanyahu ally, Gideon Sa'ar - who previously held no cabinet portfolio- will become the new foreign minister.\\n\\nGallant's removal will come into effect in 48 hours. The appointment of the new ministers requires the approval of the government and then the Knesset.\\n\\nNetanyahu first fired Gallant in March 2023 following their disagreement over controversial plans to overhaul the justice system.\\n\\nBut he was forced to retract the sacking following massive public protests in several cities in Israel - an event that became known as \\\"Gallant Night.\\\"\\n\\nIn May this year, Gallant voiced open frustration at the government\\u2019s failure to address the question of a post-war plan for Gaza. Gallant wanted Netanyahu to declare publicly that Israel has no plans to take over civilian and military rule in Gaza.\\n\\nIt was a rare public sign of divisions within Israel's war cabinet over the direction of the military campaign.\\n\\n\\u201cSince October, I have been raising this issue consistently in the cabinet,\\u201d Gallant said, \\u201cand have received no response\\\".\\n\\nNetanyahu responded by saying that he was \\\"not ready to exchange Hamastan for Fatahstan,\\\" in reference to rival Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah.\\n\\nResponding to Gallant's removal on Tuesday night, members of Israel's political opposition parties called for protests from the public.\\n\\nGallant\\u2019s dismissal also takes place on the day of the presidential election in the US- Israel\\u2019s key backer in its war in Gaza - a timing noted by several Israeli media outlets.\\n\\nGallant was viewed as having a much better relationship with the White House than Netanyahu.\\n\\nA representative for the White House's National Security Council said on Tuesday: \\\"Minister Gallant has been an important partner on all matters related to the defence of Israel. As close partners, we will continue to work collaboratively with Israel\\u2019s next minister of defence.\\\"\\n\\nObservers note that Gallant's removal also comes at a time where Netanyahu is under pressure by far-right politicians to pass a bill which would have continued to allow Israel's ultra-Orthodox citizens to be exempt from serving in the military. Gallant had been a high-profile opponent of the bill.\",\n",

This loss has compounded the family\\u2019s suffering immeasurably,\\u201d the family said in a statement released through a nonprofit group helping with the search.\\n\\nAs the search for Hannah continues, here\\u2019s what we know:\\n\\nA planned trip to New York\\n\\nHannah had plans to spend time with an aunt in upstate New York earlier this month.\\n\\nOn November 8, she took a flight from Maui to Los Angeles. She was supposed to take a connecting flight from Los Angeles International Airport to John F. Kennedy International Airport the same day but did not board, her sister, Sydni, previously told CNN.\\n\\nHannah had the same itinerary as an ex-boyfriend. The pair decided to keep their flights since they could not get a refund but would be going their separate ways once they landed in New York, Sydni said.\\n\\nThe next day, Hannah was spotted at a Taschen bookstore at The Grove shopping center in Los Angeles, her sister said, and it is unclear why she was there. Hannah then sent a Venmo payment to two people whose names the family does not recognize, Sydni said.\\n\\nOn Sunday, November 10, a video was posted on YouTube showing Hannah at the LeBron XXII Trial Experience, an event held at the Nike store in the same shopping center. A photo of the event was also posted on her Instagram account, her sister said.\\n\\nOn November 11 \\u2013 the last day anyone heard from the missing woman \\u2013 her mother texted her, asking whether she made it to New York. Hannah responded no, her sister said. Hannah also sent messages to a friend saying she did not feel safe, and someone was trying to steal her identity and money, according to screenshots her sister sent to CNN.\\n\\n\\u201cDeep Hackers wiped my identity, stole all of my funds, & have had me on a mind f**k since Friday,\\u201d one message to a friend said.\\n\\nAnother message said, \\u201cI got tricked pretty much into giving away all my funds,\\u201d followed by one saying, \\u201cFor someone I thought I loved.\\u201d\\n\\nOn November 15, the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s missing persons unit made a poster about Hannah\\u2019s disappearance, saying she was last seen at the airport. It said she has freckles on her face and a tattoo on her forearm.\\n\\nIn a statement posted to Facebook on November 17, Sydni said the family had obtained surveillance footage showing her sister around the downtown Metro train station near Crypto.com Arena, although it was unclear exactly when the footage was taken.\\n\\nIn the footage, Hannah is not alone and \\u201cdoes not appear to be in good condition,\\u201d the family wrote, saying they are unable to share further details.\\n\\n\\u2018Ryan died of a broken heart\\u2019\\n\\nHannah\\u2019s father Ryan traveled to Los Angeles not long after his daughter\\u2019s disappearance to help look for her.\\n\\n\\u201cHannah loved to travel. She loved photography, art, music. I wasn\\u2019t too close with her \\u2026 growing up. We haven\\u2019t had contact for a while,\\u201d the elder Kobayashi told CNN\\u2019s Veronica Miracle in an interview last week. \\u201cI\\u2019m just trying to make up. I\\u2019m trying to get her back. That\\u2019s my main focus.\\u201d\\n\\nBut after searching for his 30-year-old daughter for nearly two weeks, he was found dead, according to a family statement.\\n\\nHannah\\u2019s aunt, Larie Pidgeon, briefly spoke with CNN about Ryan\\u2019s death.\\n\\n\\u201cAs you can imagine the family is devastated,\\u201d Pidgeon said on Monday. \\u201cWe also want to make it clear that Ryan died of a broken heart.\\u201d\\n\\nA newly released statement Monday from the family said they are \\u201coverwhelmed by the immense outpouring of love and support\\u201d during this time.\\n\\n\\u201cThe loss of Ryan has been a heartbreaking tragedy for all of us, and we are forever grateful for the compassion and strength you have shown. As we navigate the unimaginable grief, we are holding onto hope and turning to our community for help,\\u201d the statement said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe search for our beloved Hannah must continue with the same love and determination that Ryan would have wanted. We need your help, we need your strength. Our family needs you. The search for our dear Hannah must continue with unwavering hope and determination. She is still out there, and we believe that together, we can bring her home,\\u201d it continued.\\n\\nA GoFundMe page has been set up to support Ryan\\u2019s fianc\\u00e9e \\u201cduring this unimaginable time.\\u201d\\n\\nCNN\\u2019s Karina Tsui, Amanda Jackson, Elizabeth Wolfe, Maria Aguilar Prieto, Natasha Chen and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.\",\n",

      "        \"text_content\": \"Why colouring clothes has a big environmental impact\\n\\nThe UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\\u2019s first digital dyeing process.\\n\\n\\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \\u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.\\n\\n\\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.\\n\\nThe apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.\\n\\nThe industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \\u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.\\n\\nAlchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.\\n\\nCalled Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.\\n\\nEndeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\\u201d says Dr Hudd.\\n\\nAlchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.\\n\\nDeveloped initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.\\n\\n\\u201cThe UK, they\\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.\\n\\nAlchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \\u201cdigital spray application\\u201d with similar environmental benefits.\\n\\nNTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\\u2019s interview request.\\n\\nKirsi Niinim\\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \\u201cquite promising\\u201d \\u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.\\n\\nBut even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.\\n\\n\\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \\u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\\u201d\\n\\nBack in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \\u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.\\n\\nAlchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \\u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.\\n\\nThe company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.\\n\\nThey will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.\\n\\nBig fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.\\n\\nAnd that\\u2019s just one company - there will be many, many more in need.\",\n",
