Last month, she received a kidney transplanted from a gene-edited pig', 'source': 'CNN', 'insertion_date': '2024-12-17T23:01:11.105309', 'text_content': 'Towana Looney is the only person in the world living with a functional pig kidney. But her doctor predicts that in less than a decade, pig-to-human organ transplants like hers could become routine.\\n\\nLooney, 53, is from Alabama and had the transplant at NYU Langone Transplant Institute in New York on November 25. Eleven days later, she was able to walk out the door as hospital staffers lined the hall and applauded. Wearing a mask and NYU Langone Health sweats, Looney held two thumbs up high in the air.\\n\\nDoctors announced Tuesday that Looney is doing well and that the kidney seems to be functioning as intended.\\n\\n“I am overjoyed. I’m blessed to have received this gift, a second chance at life,” Looney said at a news conference on Tuesday. “I am full of energy. Got an appetite I’ve never had in eight years. And of course, you know, I can go to the bathroom. I haven’t been going in eight years. Can’t get used to that.”\\n\\nAsked what she wants to do next, she said, “I want to go to Disney World.”\\n\\nFor now, she lives in an apartment near the hospital so she can get checkups every day. The team of doctors also monitors her health using artificial intelligence and wearable equipment that can keep constant track of her vitals and even potentially detect a problem like an infection before it would make her sick.\\n\\nLooney won’t be back in Alabama in time for the holidays, but her doctors say that if all goes well, she could go home in three months where she is eager to resume a normal life and spend quality time with her family and grandchildren.\\n\\nLooney has not had a normal life for some time. She was among more than 90,000 people who are currently on the waiting list for a kidney transplant in the US.\\n\\n“If I listened to the negatives and not follow the positives, I wouldn’t be here,” Looney said. “I go by faith. Know where your faith lies, and the rest will follow.”\\n\\nKidney donor becomes kidney patient\\n\\nEven before this surgery, Looney was no stranger to transplants. In 1999, she donated a kidney to her mother to help save her life. But some time later, she became one of the less than 1% of living kidney donors to develop kidney failure, according to the National Kidney Foundation.\\n\\nIn the last trimester of her pregnancy, Looney developed preeclampsia, a serious condition whose signs include high blood pressure, which damaged her remaining kidney. She also had to have a blood transfusion, and both those factors made it difficult to find a match to a kidney donor.\\n\\nIn 2016, Looney went on dialysis, a procedure to help remove waste and extra fluid from the blood. Dialysis can be helpful in the short term but can do only 10% to 15% of what a healthy kidney does, and people on dialysis face a 50% chance of dying in five years after beginning the treatment, studies show.\\n\\n“She has become sensitized to nearly every tissue type in the population, making it nearly impossible for her to find a kidney match,” said one of her doctors, Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute. “She languished for eight years on the dialysis and was waiting for a one in a million match. She began to develop problems associated with chronic dialysis dependence. Without a pathway to receiving a human kidney, she decided a gene-edited pig kidney was worth a try, and a lot of people rallied around her decision, including her husband and family.”\\n\\nLooney went on the waiting list for a kidney in 2017. Her doctors said that she was slowly losing accessible blood vessels to continue dialysis and that it would eventually stop being helpful. Without a donor match, she would die.\\n\\nLooney first heard about the option of a pig kidney transplant from Dr. Jayme Locke, then a professor of surgery and director of the Division of Transplantation at the Heersink School of Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Locke was recently appointed to a new transplant leadership position at the US Health Resources and Services Administration.\\n\\nLocke explained the work she did with xenotransplantation, the term doctors use for transplanting organs from animals to humans. Despite years of study, the field is still in its early stages; Looney is the third person to receive a kidney from a gene-edited pig while alive. But Looney jumped at the chance to try it, saying Locke hadn’t even finished asking about the approach before she agreed.\\n\\nLocke explained the odds and asked Looney why she would agree to be a part of an experimental procedure. Looney said she wanted to help people.\\n\\nLocke said Tuesday that Looney’s energy, even immediately after the transplant, said so much about what xenotransplantation can do for people.\\n\\n“To be in her room immediately post-transplant and to see her husband look at her and to describe her as having a life in her that he hasn’t seen, this rosiness in her cheeks, to watch her have FaceTime calls with her family and then see an immediate change, that is the miracle of transplantation,” Locke said. “It literally restores people to their health before they ever faced dialysis. And she felt it instantly. Her family felt it, and her community has felt it, and I think you saw that today.”\\n\\n‘I tried to make a difference’\\n\\nThe US Food and Drug Administration allows doctors to transplant organs from pigs into humans under what’s commonly known as “compassionate use,” which permits use of an experimental therapy or procedure if “comparable or satisfactory” options aren’t available.\\n\\nPigs’ organs are similar to humans’, and the speed of pigs’ reproduction means their organs can be procured quickly. Scientists can edit the genes of the pig to reduce the risk that a human body will reject its organ.\\n\\nAmong the three people to receive a kidney from a gene-edited pig while alive, she’s the first to receive a kidney with 10 gene edits. The gene edits should make the pig organ more human-friendly so that the body does not reject it. United Therapeutics, the company that developed the modified pig kidney, said Tuesday that it plans to submit to the FDA “very, very soon” so that clinical studies could start with the 10-edit kidney as early as next year.\\n\\n“I think that the next goal post is just extending the life of these kidneys and part of that is putting them in healthier people who have a better chance of living longer,” Montgomery said.\\n\\nLooney, doctors said, is healthier than the other patients who had pig kidney transplants earlier this year, and that should work to her advantage.\\n\\nIn March, 52-year-old Rick Slayman, who had end-stage renal failure, received a pig kidney transplant at Massachusetts General Hospital. The kidney worked at first, and he was able to go home after two weeks, but he died about two months later.\\n\\nIn April, NYU performed a pig kidney transplant with a mechanical heart pump for 54-year-old Lisa Pisano, who lived nearly three more months.\\n\\nIn Looney’s case, Locke said, the kidney started working right away, functioning like a kidney from a human donor would. Three weeks out, she is still in good shape.\\n\\n“This kidney is remarkable,” Locke said.\\n\\nLooney’s medical team is hopeful the kidney will continue to function so she can live a long and healthy life. At the news conference, Looney had an IV providing additional medicine to make sure her body does not reject the pig kidney.\\n\\n“I know anything can happen now, just like in dialysis, but I want to know that I tried. I tried to make a difference,” Looney said in a video made by NYU.\\n\\nOverall, Montgomery says he’s optimistic about the recent advances in the field. Scientists have been studying xenotransplantation for decades, but in the past couple of years, they’ve learned quickly about what may cause the recipient’s body to reject the organ and how to treat any problems that may be coming.\\n\\n“We have learned a tremendous amount from each transplant,” Montgomery said. “We don’t have all the answers. This field is still in its infancy, but our learning curve has been steep and fast.”\\n\\nThere are still a lot of questions about xenotransplantation. Among them: Scientists don’t know how long a pig organ might work.

Dial or text 988 or visit 988lifeline.org for free and confidential support.\\n\\nThe steps you take each day could lead you to a reduction in depression symptoms, according to a new study.\\n\\nA study published Monday in the journal JAMA Network Open found that a higher daily step count is associated with fewer depressive symptoms.\\n\\n“Our study provides further evidence that encouraging people to be active, regardless of the type or intensity of the activity, is an effective strategy for preventing depression,” said lead author of the study Dr. Bruno Bizzozero-Peroni, a postdoctoral researcher at the Health and Social Research Centre, University of Castilla-La Mancha in Spain.\\n\\nThe research was a meta-analysis, reviewing 33 studies involving more than 96,000 adults. The data suggested that the number of steps linked to reduced depression symptoms are fewer than you might think, said Dr. Karmel Choi, clinical psychologist and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Choi was not involved in the research.\\n\\n“We typically hear it’s good to get 10,000 steps a day, but here, even 7,000 steps seem to translate to better mental health,” she said.\\n\\nParticularly encouraging is that even a little increase in your daily step counts can help –– as little as 1,000 extra steps in a day can potentially reduce the risk of future depression by 9%, said Dr. Brendon Stubbs, a National Institute for Health and Care Research Advanced Fellow at King’s College London, in a statement. Stubbs was not involved in the latest research.\\n\\nMore studies are needed, however, because the studies included in the meta-analysis were largely observational and were focused on the general population rather than people with clinical depression, meaning researchers cannot say if taking steps impacts depression or if people with depression just move less, Choi said.\\n\\nThe movements that work for you\\n\\nWhile there are gaps in the research that call for more work to be done, it isn’t surprising that more movement was associated with a reduction in depression symptoms. And taking more steps isn’t the only move you can make toward better mental health, Choi said.\\n\\n“Step count is a nice proxy for physical activity, which has been consistently shown to have beneficial effects on depression risk,” she added. “That said, we should remember that step counts best capture certain kinds of movement, such as walking or running, and may be less well-suited to capture activities like yoga.”\\n\\nExperts have been interested in expanding physical activity recommendations to make them more flexible around what motivates each individual, Choi said.\\n\\nCurrently, the recommendations are centered around time, such as 150 minutes a week of moderate-to-vigorous activity, she added.\\n\\n“Choose the metric that is most motivating to you,” Choi said. “Whether it’s steps or hours, the mental health literature consistently suggests that moving to some extent is better than not moving at all.”\\n\\nWhere to find the motivation\\n\\nMany people struggle with finding the motivation to exercise –– and adding depression on top of that can make it even harder to get started.\\n\\nSetting goals and tracking activity doesn’t always seem to help, Dr. Michael Noetel, senior lecturer in the School of Psychology at the University of Queensland in Australia, said in a previous story. Noetel was not involved in the 2024 research.\\n\\n“Instead, I think we have to defer to more established wisdom about what works,” he said, pointing to support and accountability.\\n\\nYou can find those by joining a fitness group, getting a trainer or asking a loved one to go for a walk with you, Noetel added.\\n\\n“Taking a few steps toward getting that support makes it more likely that you’ll keep going,” he said.\\n\\nAnd whether your thing is weight training or walking, you need to make the activity enjoyable to keep it up.\\n\\n“Be kind to your future self by making exercise as easy and attractive as possible, like getting yourself an audiobook or a trial at a yoga studio,” Noetel said.\\n\\nThe more you enjoy your workout, the more confident you will be to overcome exercise obstacles, which means you’ll be more likely to stick with a regimen, according to a 2015 study.\\n\\n“Then, be kind to yourself if it’s hard — we always forget how easy it is for life to get in the way of exercise, so make a backup plan as if your happiness depended on it,” Noetel said. “Because it does.”', 'top_image': None, 'entities': [{'id': 'b4a2dcf4-e7b9-4621-944e-3fadcd3cecab', 'name': 'Choi', 'entity_type': 'person', 'locations': []}, {'id': '666a46bd-9a95-4514-886d-2502d999cf17', 'name': 'Noetel', 'entity_type': 'person', 'locations': []}], 'tags': [], 'evaluation': None}, {'id': '61d968c3-fd16-44b7-9dac-7f5d058be7d8', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/17/politics/trump-voter-doubts-analysis/index.html', 'title': 'Many Trump voters still have doubts about him.

Trump also won many voters who disagree with some of his top policy priorities, including his pledge to execute the largest deportation ever of undocumented immigrants, according to both the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations that includes CNN and the AP VoteCast survey conducted by the NORC at the University of Chicago.\\n\\nFor these conflicted Trump voters, both surveys show, those concerns were overshadowed by discontent over the outcomes of Joe Biden’s presidency and the belief that Trump would produce better results than Vice President Kamala Harris on the issues they cared most about: immigration, crime and, above all, inflation and the cost of living.\\n\\nThe long-term implications of Trump’s 2024 victory may turn on whether his performance in office solidifies or severs his connection to those conflicted supporters. If voters conclude that Trump has delivered on his core campaign promises of securing the border, increasing public safety and providing more economic stability, strategists in both parties believe the GOP has the opportunity to cement the formidable gains he registered this year among several traditionally Democratic-leaning voter groups, including younger White men, Black men and Latino people overall.\\n\\n“If he has a record of success he can point to, the stage is set to continue to expand the Republican coalition,” said Jim McLaughlin, a lead pollster for Trump’s campaign.\\n\\nTrump clearly is entering the White House in a stronger position than after his first election in 2016. His popular vote win – the only time he has done so since he first entered politics – has given his 2024 victory more legitimacy and most voters are expressing optimism he will improve their personal finances. And while Trump faced skepticism during his first term from the GOP leaders in the House (Paul Ryan) and Senate (Mitch McConnell), now the party’s leadership in both chambers shows little inclination to cross him.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the Supreme Court, his three appointments have created a solid conservative majority that is more likely to back him than the closely divided court he inherited when he arrived in office. Business leaders who kept their distance the first time have trekked to Mar-a-Lago to signal their desire to work with him. And Trump’s gains among traditionally Democratic-leaning constituencies, especially non-White men, have left the party much more tentative about how to oppose him this time around.\\n\\nBut once Trump takes office again, he faces the risk that at least some of his conflicted supporters will recoil as the elements of his personality and program that still concerned them on Election Day inevitably receive more attention. That risk will be greatly compounded for Trump if voters don’t see improvement on the issues they care most about – particularly their cost of living.\\n\\n“Nothing that Trump has talked about doing, whether it’s tariffs, tax cuts for wealthy people or the deportation plan, none of that is going to help people’s pocketbooks,” argued Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, chief strategy officer for Way to Win, a liberal group that focuses on electing progressive candidates of color. “And so that is an opening to hold him accountable on that, to educate people about that.”\\n\\nUneasy about Trump’s agenda\\n\\nOn a wide array of measures, the exit polls and AP VoteCast show that Trump won a crucial slice of voters who continued to express substantial unease about him and/or his agenda.\\n\\nIn the exit polls, about 1 in 8 voters who described Trump as “too extreme” still voted for him. In the VoteCast survey, which phrased the question slightly differently, Trump won fully one-fifth of voters who said they were either very or somewhat concerned that his views were too extreme. Likewise, in the VoteCast survey, Trump won 1 in 6 voters who expressed concern that he would steer the country in an authoritarian direction. Trump won almost exactly the same share of voters who said in the VoteCast survey that he lacks the moral character to serve as president.\\n\\nThe same pattern held on key issues. In both the exit polls and VoteCast surveys, about 3 in 10 voters who said abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances voted for Trump. In both surveys, that was a slightly higher percentage of pro-choice voters who supported Trump than in the 2020 election – before three of the justices he nominated to the Supreme Court provided critical votes to overturn the constitutional right to abortion in 2022.\\n\\nIn both surveys, Trump also won a vital segment of voters who opposed his plan for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. In the exit polls, Trump won just over 1 in 5 voters who said most undocumented immigrants should not be deported but rather given an opportunity to apply for legal status; VoteCast put his support among voters who opposed mass deportation at 1-in-4.\\n\\nEven among the voter groups most directly affected by these policies, Trump won substantial support from people who disagreed with him. In the exit polls, Trump won nearly one-fourth of Latinos who opposed mass deportation and slightly more than one-fourth of women who said that abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances. That was, again, an increase from 2020, when the exit polls found that Trump won only about one-fifth of women who supported legal abortion. On both issues, the AP VoteCast survey produced very similar results.\\n\\nAll of this support was decisive in Trump’s victory. Whether in the exit polls or VoteCast, most voters said they worried Trump was too extreme, lacked the character to serve as president, or would steer the country in an authoritarian direction. Most in both surveys also opposed mass deportation and supported legal abortion. In the VoteCast survey, a clear majority of voters said they wanted the federal government to do more to expand access to health insurance and exactly half said they wanted government to do more to provide access to childhood vaccines – neither of which is likely under Trump. Without support from a substantial minority of the voters who held those negative or contrary views, Trump could not have won.\\n\\nFixing the economy\\n\\nAbove all, the key to Trump’s success among these divided voters was their discontent over the economy, and their belief that Trump would improve their financial situation.\\n\\nMolly Murphy, a lead pollster for Harris, told me that she believed voters who thought Trump would improve conditions on the issue they cared most about – usually inflation, but also in some cases reinforced by immigration or crime – minimized any of these other personal or policy concerns about him.\\n\\n“If they thought that Trump was going to be better on their primary concern… They either forgave the other concerns or convinced themselves that” the elements of the Trump agenda they disliked “just won’t happen,” Murphy said.\\n\\nThe major post-election surveys support that analysis. Exit polls results provided by the CNN polling unit show that Trump won one-third of the voters who said he was too extreme, but also said they were financially worse off than they were when he left office. (Among those who said their financial situation was even unchanged from four years ago, Trump only won 1 in every 11 voters who called him too extreme.) In the VoteCast survey, Trump similarly won 3 in 10 voters who said he lacked the moral character to serve as president, but who also described the economy as not so good or poor. (Less than 1 in 14 voters who believed Trump lacked moral character and were positive on the economy voted for him.)\\n\\nThe economy’s critical role in offsetting doubts on other fronts about Trump is most apparent when looking at the role of abortion in the election. In 2022, as I wrote at the time, abortion did not overcome the Republican tilt of voters in red states such as Florida and Texas, but did prove a huge asset for Democrats in swing states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona.\\n\\nBut Harris didn’t win nearly as many pro-choice voters this time as Democratic gubernatorial and Senate candidates did then – or even, as noted above, as Biden did in 2020, long before the overturning of Roe v. Wade. McLaughlin, the Trump pollster, attributes that shift largely to the former president’s success at convincing voters he would not seek a national abortion ban and would leave the issue to the states.\\n\\n“Democrats kind of snuck up on the Republicans in ’22 with the abortion issue,” McLaughlin said. “And the Trump campaign made it a real emphasis to say we don’t support a national abortion ban. In most states, people were comfortable with the abortion laws, it had become a state’s right issues, and Donald Trump was not a threat to them on that issue.”\\n\\nBut the election polls also made clear that many voters who supported abortion rights simply put more stress on the economy. Fully 36% of all voters said in the exit polls that they supported legal abortion in all or most circumstances, but also viewed the economy in negative terms. In many respects, as I’ve written, that was the collision of Harris’s greatest strength – the fear that Trump would rescind voters’ rights – against Trump’s – the belief that the Biden-Harris administration had mismanaged the economy. The exit polls found that Trump narrowly beat Harris among those pro-choice, economically-pessimistic voters, while the VoteCast survey gave Harris a tiny advantage among them. In either case, the result was that Trump won far too many voters who supported legal abortion for Harris to prevail.\\n\\n“On abortion specifically, I think those voters either concluded through his messaging or through their magical thinking that because he talks about the economy and the border most of the time, he probably doesn’t care about abortion,” Murphy said.\\n\\nThat trade-off was especially brutal for Harris among White women without a college education. Those women are a huge voting bloc and always critical to the outcome in the three Rust Belt states that once again functioned as the tipping point of this election: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\\n\\nDemocrats had hoped Harris might improve over Biden’s 2020 performance with those blue-collar White women after the party’s gubernatorial candidates had all run relatively strongly with them in 2022, the first election following the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe. But Trump either matched or exceeded his 2020 margins among those women in all three states, both the exit polls and VoteCast found. A key reason: Trump routed Harris by about 2-to-1 among the White women without a college degree who supported legal abortion but were negative on the economy, according to figures provided by the CNN polling unit. Trump even won nearly half of college-educated White women, a much more Democratic-leaning bloc, who supported legal abortion but viewed the economy negatively, the exit polls found.\\n\\nFernandez Ancona said their group’s polling around the election showed that discontent over the economy and the border outweighed other doubts voters held about Trump – but did not erase them. “I do not read the data as showing a fundamental realignment among the traditionally Democratic coalition,” she argued. “It’s a very reluctant kind of support that they’re giving to Trump because they are tired of the status quo. Harris was primarily advocating for a return to the status quo. And they were saying, ‘I had to put my concerns about him aside because the economy has been so bad under Democrats.’”\\n\\nMurphy, though, said it is a mistake for Democrats to think of the conflicted Trump voters as “ambivalent” or choosing him only as the lesser of two evils in their minds. Despite their doubts about Trump, she said, they were affirmatively voting for him because they had become convinced he would provide more financial stability for their families.\\n\\nBut, Murphy argues, holding those conflicted voters won’t be easy for Trump once he enters office and starts implementing the full sweep of his agenda. Once in office, she said, “I think his numbers crater for two reasons.” One, she said, “is because the things he will try to do are on their face unpopular.” The other risk he faces, she said, is that if Trump becomes entangled in political firefights over pardoning January 6, 2021, rioters, or ending birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants, or allowing his appointees to undermine childhood vaccines, it will violate those voters’ expectations that he would prioritize their economic well-being.\\n\\n“The trade that many of these voters felt they were making was in some ways rooted in the idea that he wasn’t going to do [these things] or it wasn’t going to be a priority,” Murphy said. “When that’s what you are doing, you are telling voters about the economy not being a priority… and [that] gives Democrats a huge opportunity to lift up that he’s not someone you can trust to lead in your interests.”\\n\\nWhit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster, agreed that if Trump overreads his mandate, he could quickly strain his support among the voters ambivalent about him-including not only the racial minorities he drew into his coalition but white-collar Republicans who reluctantly backed him because they viewed Biden and Harris as too liberal.\\n\\nIf Trump provides his most controversial nominees – such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and Kash Patel as director of the FBI – a “blank check” to pursue polarizing agendas, Ayres said, “we are going to be looking at Joe Biden level-job approval numbers before we turn around” for Trump.\\n\\nWhat feelings about Trump could mean for Republicans\\n\\nTrump, if he follows the constitutional limit on presidential terms, won’t appear on a ballot again himself. But his standing will affect the GOP’s position in the 2026 midterm elections and the race to succeed him in 2028 – just as Biden’s weakened position created an enormous, and likely insurmountable, headwind for Harris this year.\\n\\nIssues that were overshadowed by the economy in the 2024 election could still weaken Trump, and by extension other Republicans. Ayres, for instance, says Trump and the GOP will be hurt if Kennedy is confirmed and his anti-vaccination rhetoric contributes to future outbreaks of childhood diseases like measles. And any move by Trump’s administration to restrict access to abortion – for instance, by rolling back Biden’s moves to ease access to medication abortion – could alienate voters who believed him when he said he believed the issue should now be left to the states. Polls leave little doubt that most voters are dubious of widespread pardons for the January 6 rioters – something Trump has pledged to pursue within his first hours of a second term.\\n\\nBut the dynamics of Trump’s victory last month illuminate that issues more central to voters’ daily lives remain most likely to function as the pivot point of the next four years. Both McLaughlin, the Trump pollster, and Murphy, the Harris pollster, point to the same straightforward central explanation for why voters returned him to the White House. “Voters didn’t like the direction of the country and they thought he could make their lives better,” McLaughlin said. Echoed Murphy: “For voters, he was just the guy from the other party when they were unhappy.”\\n\\nIf voters feel that their lives are improving over the next four years, the example of 2024 suggests they will suppress their other concerns about Trump and continue to support him, a trend that would benefit GOP candidates in 2026 and 2028. “He knows that if he is successful everything else will take care of itself,” said McLaughlin. “He knows his legacy is all contingent on having a strong economy.”\\n\\nBut if Trump doesn’t reward the faith of these conflicted voters by making progress on the issues that most concern them, they may inexorably turn their focus back toward their other hesitations about him, a trend that would hurt GOP candidates in the coming elections. “Performance matters,” said Ayres. “Performance drives job approval and job approval drives votes.

LeBlanc, who has been close friends with the prime minister since childhood, is considered one of his most loyal allies.\\n\\nTrudeau was present at the swearing-in - his first appearance in front of media since Freeland\\'s announcement - but he did not provide any statements. His office and the finance department both did not respond to the BBC\\'s request for comment.\\n\\nIn her publicly-shared resignation letter, Freeland said Canada needs to keep its \"fiscal powder dry\" to deal with the threat of sweeping tariffs from US President-elect Donald Trump.\\n\\nShe added this means \"eschewing costly political gimmicks\" that Canada cannot afford.\\n\\nTrump has promised to impose a levy of 25% on imported Canadian goods, which economists have warned would significantly hurt Canada\\'s economy.\\n\\nReferencing the tariffs, Freeland called them a \"threat\" that needs to be taken \"extremely seriously\".\\n\\nShe added that this means \"pushing back against \\'America First\\' economic nationalism\" and working with unity in response to these tariff threats.\\n\\nWhen the fall economic statement was released on Monday afternoon, it revealed a C$60b deficit ($42bn; £33bn) - far exceeding Freeland\\'s C$40bn target.\\n\\nShe and Trudeau were reportedly also in disagreement over a series of recently-proposed policies by the prime minister designed to address the country\\'s cost-of-living crisis.\\n\\nAmong them is a cheque of C$250 that the government wanted to send to every Canadian earning less than C$150,000 annually. These cheques were expected to cost the federal government a total of C$4.68bn.\\n\\nAnother is a temporary tax break on essential items during the holidays which is anticipated to cost C$1.6bn in lost tax revenue.\\n\\nFreeland\\'s office had reportedly been concerned about the price of these two policies, saying they are economically unwise at a time when the country\\'s deficit is growing.\\n\\nThe tax holiday has since been approved in the House of Commons, but the C$250-cheques hit a hurdle when the New Democratic Party (NDP) - a centre-left party in parliament - signalled it would not lend its support to the policy unless it is expanded.\\n\\nA poll by the Angus Reid Institute showed that four out of five Canadians viewed the cheques as a political move designed to win public goodwill as Trudeau\\'s popularity plummets.\\n\\nIn response to Freeland\\'s exit, Pierre Poilievre, leader of the opposition Conservative Party of Canada, called for a federal election as soon as possible.\\n\\n\"Everything is spiralling out of control.

She was among more than 90,000 people who are currently on the waiting list for a kidney transplant in the US.\\n\\n\\u201cIf I listened to the negatives and not follow the positives, I wouldn\\u2019t be here,\\u201d Looney said. \\u201cI go by faith. Know where your faith lies, and the rest will follow.\\u201d\\n\\nKidney donor becomes kidney patient\\n\\nEven before this surgery, Looney was no stranger to transplants. In 1999, she donated a kidney to her mother to help save her life. But some time later, she became one of the less than 1% of living kidney donors to develop kidney failure, according to the National Kidney Foundation.\\n\\nIn the last trimester of her pregnancy, Looney developed preeclampsia, a serious condition whose signs include high blood pressure, which damaged her remaining kidney. She also had to have a blood transfusion, and both those factors made it difficult to find a match to a kidney donor.\\n\\nIn 2016, Looney went on dialysis, a procedure to help remove waste and extra fluid from the blood. Dialysis can be helpful in the short term but can do only 10% to 15% of what a healthy kidney does, and people on dialysis face a 50% chance of dying in five years after beginning the treatment, studies show.\\n\\n\\u201cShe has become sensitized to nearly every tissue type in the population, making it nearly impossible for her to find a kidney match,\\u201d said one of her doctors, Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute. \\u201cShe languished for eight years on the dialysis and was waiting for a one in a million match. She began to develop problems associated with chronic dialysis dependence. Without a pathway to receiving a human kidney, she decided a gene-edited pig kidney was worth a try, and a lot of people rallied around her decision, including her husband and family.\\u201d\\n\\nLooney went on the waiting list for a kidney in 2017. Her doctors said that she was slowly losing accessible blood vessels to continue dialysis and that it would eventually stop being helpful. Without a donor match, she would die.\\n\\nLooney first heard about the option of a pig kidney transplant from Dr. Jayme Locke, then a professor of surgery and director of the Division of Transplantation at the Heersink School of Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Locke was recently appointed to a new transplant leadership position at the US Health Resources and Services Administration.\\n\\nLocke explained the work she did with xenotransplantation, the term doctors use for transplanting organs from animals to humans. Despite years of study, the field is still in its early stages; Looney is the third person to receive a kidney from a gene-edited pig while alive. But Looney jumped at the chance to try it, saying Locke hadn\\u2019t even finished asking about the approach before she agreed.\\n\\nLocke explained the odds and asked Looney why she would agree to be a part of an experimental procedure. Looney said she wanted to help people.\\n\\nLocke said Tuesday that Looney\\u2019s energy, even immediately after the transplant, said so much about what xenotransplantation can do for people.\\n\\n\\u201cTo be in her room immediately post-transplant and to see her husband look at her and to describe her as having a life in her that he hasn\\u2019t seen, this rosiness in her cheeks, to watch her have FaceTime calls with her family and then see an immediate change, that is the miracle of transplantation,\\u201d Locke said. \\u201cIt literally restores people to their health before they ever faced dialysis. And she felt it instantly. Her family felt it, and her community has felt it, and I think you saw that today.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2018I tried to make a difference\\u2019\\n\\nThe US Food and Drug Administration allows doctors to transplant organs from pigs into humans under what\\u2019s commonly known as \\u201ccompassionate use,\\u201d which permits use of an experimental therapy or procedure if \\u201ccomparable or satisfactory\\u201d options aren\\u2019t available.\\n\\nPigs\\u2019 organs are similar to humans\\u2019, and the speed of pigs\\u2019 reproduction means their organs can be procured quickly. Scientists can edit the genes of the pig to reduce the risk that a human body will reject its organ.\\n\\nAmong the three people to receive a kidney from a gene-edited pig while alive, she\\u2019s the first to receive a kidney with 10 gene edits. The gene edits should make the pig organ more human-friendly so that the body does not reject it. United Therapeutics, the company that developed the modified pig kidney, said Tuesday that it plans to submit to the FDA \\u201cvery, very soon\\u201d so that clinical studies could start with the 10-edit kidney as early as next year.\\n\\n\\u201cI think that the next goal post is just extending the life of these kidneys and part of that is putting them in healthier people who have a better chance of living longer,\\u201d Montgomery said.\\n\\nLooney, doctors said, is healthier than the other patients who had pig kidney transplants earlier this year, and that should work to her advantage.\\n\\nIn March, 52-year-old Rick Slayman, who had end-stage renal failure, received a pig kidney transplant at Massachusetts General Hospital. The kidney worked at first, and he was able to go home after two weeks, but he died about two months later.\\n\\nIn April, NYU performed a pig kidney transplant with a mechanical heart pump for 54-year-old Lisa Pisano, who lived nearly three more months.\\n\\nIn Looney\\u2019s case, Locke said, the kidney started working right away, functioning like a kidney from a human donor would. Three weeks out, she is still in good shape.\\n\\n\\u201cThis kidney is remarkable,\\u201d Locke said.\\n\\nLooney\\u2019s medical team is hopeful the kidney will continue to function so she can live a long and healthy life. At the news conference, Looney had an IV providing additional medicine to make sure her body does not reject the pig kidney.\\n\\n\\u201cI know anything can happen now, just like in dialysis, but I want to know that I tried. I tried to make a difference,\\u201d Looney said in a video made by NYU.\\n\\nOverall, Montgomery says he\\u2019s optimistic about the recent advances in the field. Scientists have been studying xenotransplantation for decades, but in the past couple of years, they\\u2019ve learned quickly about what may cause the recipient\\u2019s body to reject the organ and how to treat any problems that may be coming.\\n\\n\\u201cWe have learned a tremendous amount from each transplant,\\u201d Montgomery said. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have all the answers. This field is still in its infancy, but our learning curve has been steep and fast.\\u201d\\n\\nThere are still a lot of questions about xenotransplantation. Among them: Scientists don\\u2019t know how long a pig organ might work. But Montgomery makes a bold prediction that xenotransplantation will become routine in less than 10 years.\\n\\nMontgomery said the challenge going forward will be to learn how to support kidneys for longer periods so that they can become \\u201ca reasonable alternative for this scarce, highly rationed supply of human organs.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPatients like Towana are our pioneers who, through their courage, will show us the way,\\u201d Montgomery said.\\n\\nHaving that option could be transformative: About 13 people in the US die each day waiting for a kidney transplant.\\n\\nLooney said it\\u2019s been wonderful to live without the need to go to dialysis all day.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s like I can feel the blood pumping through my veins. You can put your hand on my fistula and feel it buzzing. I could put my hand on this kidney and feel it buzzing. It\\u2019s so strong,\\u201d Looney said. \\u201cEmotionally, I\\u2019m overjoyed.\\u201d\\n\\nCNN\\u2019s Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.\",\n",

Dial or text 988 or visit 988lifeline.org for free and confidential support.\\n\\nThe steps you take each day could lead you to a reduction in depression symptoms, according to a new study.\\n\\nA study published Monday in the journal JAMA Network Open found that a higher daily step count is associated with fewer depressive symptoms.\\n\\n\\u201cOur study provides further evidence that encouraging people to be active, regardless of the type or intensity of the activity, is an effective strategy for preventing depression,\\u201d said lead author of the study Dr. Bruno Bizzozero-Peroni, a postdoctoral researcher at the Health and Social Research Centre, University of Castilla-La Mancha in Spain.\\n\\nThe research was a meta-analysis, reviewing 33 studies involving more than 96,000 adults. The data suggested that the number of steps linked to reduced depression symptoms are fewer than you might think, said Dr. Karmel Choi, clinical psychologist and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Choi was not involved in the research.\\n\\n\\u201cWe typically hear it\\u2019s good to get 10,000 steps a day, but here, even 7,000 steps seem to translate to better mental health,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nParticularly encouraging is that even a little increase in your daily step counts can help \\u2013\\u2013 as little as 1,000 extra steps in a day can potentially reduce the risk of future depression by 9%, said Dr. Brendon Stubbs, a National Institute for Health and Care Research Advanced Fellow at King\\u2019s College London, in a statement. Stubbs was not involved in the latest research.\\n\\nMore studies are needed, however, because the studies included in the meta-analysis were largely observational and were focused on the general population rather than people with clinical depression, meaning researchers cannot say if taking steps impacts depression or if people with depression just move less, Choi said.\\n\\nThe movements that work for you\\n\\nWhile there are gaps in the research that call for more work to be done, it isn\\u2019t surprising that more movement was associated with a reduction in depression symptoms. And taking more steps isn\\u2019t the only move you can make toward better mental health, Choi said.\\n\\n\\u201cStep count is a nice proxy for physical activity, which has been consistently shown to have beneficial effects on depression risk,\\u201d she added. \\u201cThat said, we should remember that step counts best capture certain kinds of movement, such as walking or running, and may be less well-suited to capture activities like yoga.\\u201d\\n\\nExperts have been interested in expanding physical activity recommendations to make them more flexible around what motivates each individual, Choi said.\\n\\nCurrently, the recommendations are centered around time, such as 150 minutes a week of moderate-to-vigorous activity, she added.\\n\\n\\u201cChoose the metric that is most motivating to you,\\u201d Choi said. \\u201cWhether it\\u2019s steps or hours, the mental health literature consistently suggests that moving to some extent is better than not moving at all.\\u201d\\n\\nWhere to find the motivation\\n\\nMany people struggle with finding the motivation to exercise \\u2013\\u2013 and adding depression on top of that can make it even harder to get started.\\n\\nSetting goals and tracking activity doesn\\u2019t always seem to help, Dr. Michael Noetel, senior lecturer in the School of Psychology at the University of Queensland in Australia, said in a previous story. Noetel was not involved in the 2024 research.\\n\\n\\u201cInstead, I think we have to defer to more established wisdom about what works,\\u201d he said, pointing to support and accountability.\\n\\nYou can find those by joining a fitness group, getting a trainer or asking a loved one to go for a walk with you, Noetel added.\\n\\n\\u201cTaking a few steps toward getting that support makes it more likely that you\\u2019ll keep going,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nAnd whether your thing is weight training or walking, you need to make the activity enjoyable to keep it up.\\n\\n\\u201cBe kind to your future self by making exercise as easy and attractive as possible, like getting yourself an audiobook or a trial at a yoga studio,\\u201d Noetel said.\\n\\nThe more you enjoy your workout, the more confident you will be to overcome exercise obstacles, which means you\\u2019ll be more likely to stick with a regimen, according to a 2015 study.\\n\\n\\u201cThen, be kind to yourself if it\\u2019s hard \\u2014 we always forget how easy it is for life to get in the way of exercise, so make a backup plan as if your happiness depended on it,\\u201d Noetel said. \\u201cBecause it does.\\u201d\",\n",

Trump also won many voters who disagree with some of his top policy priorities, including his pledge to execute the largest deportation ever of undocumented immigrants, according to both the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations that includes CNN and the AP VoteCast survey conducted by the NORC at the University of Chicago.\\n\\nFor these conflicted Trump voters, both surveys show, those concerns were overshadowed by discontent over the outcomes of Joe Biden\\u2019s presidency and the belief that Trump would produce better results than Vice President Kamala Harris on the issues they cared most about: immigration, crime and, above all, inflation and the cost of living.\\n\\nThe long-term implications of Trump\\u2019s 2024 victory may turn on whether his performance in office solidifies or severs his connection to those conflicted supporters. If voters conclude that Trump has delivered on his core campaign promises of securing the border, increasing public safety and providing more economic stability, strategists in both parties believe the GOP has the opportunity to cement the formidable gains he registered this year among several traditionally Democratic-leaning voter groups, including younger White men, Black men and Latino people overall.\\n\\n\\u201cIf he has a record of success he can point to, the stage is set to continue to expand the Republican coalition,\\u201d said Jim McLaughlin, a lead pollster for Trump\\u2019s campaign.\\n\\nTrump clearly is entering the White House in a stronger position than after his first election in 2016. His popular vote win \\u2013 the only time he has done so since he first entered politics \\u2013 has given his 2024 victory more legitimacy and most voters are expressing optimism he will improve their personal finances. And while Trump faced skepticism during his first term from the GOP leaders in the House (Paul Ryan) and Senate (Mitch McConnell), now the party\\u2019s leadership in both chambers shows little inclination to cross him.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the Supreme Court, his three appointments have created a solid conservative majority that is more likely to back him than the closely divided court he inherited when he arrived in office. Business leaders who kept their distance the first time have trekked to Mar-a-Lago to signal their desire to work with him. And Trump\\u2019s gains among traditionally Democratic-leaning constituencies, especially non-White men, have left the party much more tentative about how to oppose him this time around.\\n\\nBut once Trump takes office again, he faces the risk that at least some of his conflicted supporters will recoil as the elements of his personality and program that still concerned them on Election Day inevitably receive more attention. That risk will be greatly compounded for Trump if voters don\\u2019t see improvement on the issues they care most about \\u2013 particularly their cost of living.\\n\\n\\u201cNothing that Trump has talked about doing, whether it\\u2019s tariffs, tax cuts for wealthy people or the deportation plan, none of that is going to help people\\u2019s pocketbooks,\\u201d argued Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, chief strategy officer for Way to Win, a liberal group that focuses on electing progressive candidates of color. \\u201cAnd so that is an opening to hold him accountable on that, to educate people about that.\\u201d\\n\\nUneasy about Trump\\u2019s agenda\\n\\nOn a wide array of measures, the exit polls and AP VoteCast show that Trump won a crucial slice of voters who continued to express substantial unease about him and/or his agenda.\\n\\nIn the exit polls, about 1 in 8 voters who described Trump as \\u201ctoo extreme\\u201d still voted for him. In the VoteCast survey, which phrased the question slightly differently, Trump won fully one-fifth of voters who said they were either very or somewhat concerned that his views were too extreme. Likewise, in the VoteCast survey, Trump won 1 in 6 voters who expressed concern that he would steer the country in an authoritarian direction. Trump won almost exactly the same share of voters who said in the VoteCast survey that he lacks the moral character to serve as president.\\n\\nThe same pattern held on key issues. In both the exit polls and VoteCast surveys, about 3 in 10 voters who said abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances voted for Trump. In both surveys, that was a slightly higher percentage of pro-choice voters who supported Trump than in the 2020 election \\u2013 before three of the justices he nominated to the Supreme Court provided critical votes to overturn the constitutional right to abortion in 2022.\\n\\nIn both surveys, Trump also won a vital segment of voters who opposed his plan for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. In the exit polls, Trump won just over 1 in 5 voters who said most undocumented immigrants should not be deported but rather given an opportunity to apply for legal status; VoteCast put his support among voters who opposed mass deportation at 1-in-4.\\n\\nEven among the voter groups most directly affected by these policies, Trump won substantial support from people who disagreed with him. In the exit polls, Trump won nearly one-fourth of Latinos who opposed mass deportation and slightly more than one-fourth of women who said that abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances. That was, again, an increase from 2020, when the exit polls found that Trump won only about one-fifth of women who supported legal abortion. On both issues, the AP VoteCast survey produced very similar results.\\n\\nAll of this support was decisive in Trump\\u2019s victory. Whether in the exit polls or VoteCast, most voters said they worried Trump was too extreme, lacked the character to serve as president, or would steer the country in an authoritarian direction. Most in both surveys also opposed mass deportation and supported legal abortion. In the VoteCast survey, a clear majority of voters said they wanted the federal government to do more to expand access to health insurance and exactly half said they wanted government to do more to provide access to childhood vaccines \\u2013 neither of which is likely under Trump. Without support from a substantial minority of the voters who held those negative or contrary views, Trump could not have won.\\n\\nFixing the economy\\n\\nAbove all, the key to Trump\\u2019s success among these divided voters was their discontent over the economy, and their belief that Trump would improve their financial situation.\\n\\nMolly Murphy, a lead pollster for Harris, told me that she believed voters who thought Trump would improve conditions on the issue they cared most about \\u2013 usually inflation, but also in some cases reinforced by immigration or crime \\u2013 minimized any of these other personal or policy concerns about him.\\n\\n\\u201cIf they thought that Trump was going to be better on their primary concern\\u2026 They either forgave the other concerns or convinced themselves that\\u201d the elements of the Trump agenda they disliked \\u201cjust won\\u2019t happen,\\u201d Murphy said.\\n\\nThe major post-election surveys support that analysis. Exit polls results provided by the CNN polling unit show that Trump won one-third of the voters who said he was too extreme, but also said they were financially worse off than they were when he left office. (Among those who said their financial situation was even unchanged from four years ago, Trump only won 1 in every 11 voters who called him too extreme.) In the VoteCast survey, Trump similarly won 3 in 10 voters who said he lacked the moral character to serve as president, but who also described the economy as not so good or poor. (Less than 1 in 14 voters who believed Trump lacked moral character and were positive on the economy voted for him.)\\n\\nThe economy\\u2019s critical role in offsetting doubts on other fronts about Trump is most apparent when looking at the role of abortion in the election. In 2022, as I wrote at the time, abortion did not overcome the Republican tilt of voters in red states such as Florida and Texas, but did prove a huge asset for Democrats in swing states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona.\\n\\nBut Harris didn\\u2019t win nearly as many pro-choice voters this time as Democratic gubernatorial and Senate candidates did then \\u2013 or even, as noted above, as Biden did in 2020, long before the overturning of Roe v. Wade. McLaughlin, the Trump pollster, attributes that shift largely to the former president\\u2019s success at convincing voters he would not seek a national abortion ban and would leave the issue to the states.\\n\\n\\u201cDemocrats kind of snuck up on the Republicans in \\u201922 with the abortion issue,\\u201d McLaughlin said. \\u201cAnd the Trump campaign made it a real emphasis to say we don\\u2019t support a national abortion ban. In most states, people were comfortable with the abortion laws, it had become a state\\u2019s right issues, and Donald Trump was not a threat to them on that issue.\\u201d\\n\\nBut the election polls also made clear that many voters who supported abortion rights simply put more stress on the economy. Fully 36% of all voters said in the exit polls that they supported legal abortion in all or most circumstances, but also viewed the economy in negative terms. In many respects, as I\\u2019ve written, that was the collision of Harris\\u2019s greatest strength \\u2013 the fear that Trump would rescind voters\\u2019 rights \\u2013 against Trump\\u2019s \\u2013 the belief that the Biden-Harris administration had mismanaged the economy. The exit polls found that Trump narrowly beat Harris among those pro-choice, economically-pessimistic voters, while the VoteCast survey gave Harris a tiny advantage among them. In either case, the result was that Trump won far too many voters who supported legal abortion for Harris to prevail.\\n\\n\\u201cOn abortion specifically, I think those voters either concluded through his messaging or through their magical thinking that because he talks about the economy and the border most of the time, he probably doesn\\u2019t care about abortion,\\u201d Murphy said.\\n\\nThat trade-off was especially brutal for Harris among White women without a college education. Those women are a huge voting bloc and always critical to the outcome in the three Rust Belt states that once again functioned as the tipping point of this election: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\\n\\nDemocrats had hoped Harris might improve over Biden\\u2019s 2020 performance with those blue-collar White women after the party\\u2019s gubernatorial candidates had all run relatively strongly with them in 2022, the first election following the Supreme Court\\u2019s decision overturning Roe. But Trump either matched or exceeded his 2020 margins among those women in all three states, both the exit polls and VoteCast found. A key reason: Trump routed Harris by about 2-to-1 among the White women without a college degree who supported legal abortion but were negative on the economy, according to figures provided by the CNN polling unit. Trump even won nearly half of college-educated White women, a much more Democratic-leaning bloc, who supported legal abortion but viewed the economy negatively, the exit polls found.\\n\\nFernandez Ancona said their group\\u2019s polling around the election showed that discontent over the economy and the border outweighed other doubts voters held about Trump \\u2013 but did not erase them. \\u201cI do not read the data as showing a fundamental realignment among the traditionally Democratic coalition,\\u201d she argued. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a very reluctant kind of support that they\\u2019re giving to Trump because they are tired of the status quo. Harris was primarily advocating for a return to the status quo. And they were saying, \\u2018I had to put my concerns about him aside because the economy has been so bad under Democrats.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nMurphy, though, said it is a mistake for Democrats to think of the conflicted Trump voters as \\u201cambivalent\\u201d or choosing him only as the lesser of two evils in their minds. Despite their doubts about Trump, she said, they were affirmatively voting for him because they had become convinced he would provide more financial stability for their families.\\n\\nBut, Murphy argues, holding those conflicted voters won\\u2019t be easy for Trump once he enters office and starts implementing the full sweep of his agenda. Once in office, she said, \\u201cI think his numbers crater for two reasons.\\u201d One, she said, \\u201cis because the things he will try to do are on their face unpopular.\\u201d The other risk he faces, she said, is that if Trump becomes entangled in political firefights over pardoning January 6, 2021, rioters, or ending birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants, or allowing his appointees to undermine childhood vaccines, it will violate those voters\\u2019 expectations that he would prioritize their economic well-being.\\n\\n\\u201cThe trade that many of these voters felt they were making was in some ways rooted in the idea that he wasn\\u2019t going to do [these things] or it wasn\\u2019t going to be a priority,\\u201d Murphy said. \\u201cWhen that\\u2019s what you are doing, you are telling voters about the economy not being a priority\\u2026 and [that] gives Democrats a huge opportunity to lift up that he\\u2019s not someone you can trust to lead in your interests.\\u201d\\n\\nWhit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster, agreed that if Trump overreads his mandate, he could quickly strain his support among the voters ambivalent about him-including not only the racial minorities he drew into his coalition but white-collar Republicans who reluctantly backed him because they viewed Biden and Harris as too liberal.\\n\\nIf Trump provides his most controversial nominees \\u2013 such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and Kash Patel as director of the FBI \\u2013 a \\u201cblank check\\u201d to pursue polarizing agendas, Ayres said, \\u201cwe are going to be looking at Joe Biden level-job approval numbers before we turn around\\u201d for Trump.\\n\\nWhat feelings about Trump could mean for Republicans\\n\\nTrump, if he follows the constitutional limit on presidential terms, won\\u2019t appear on a ballot again himself. But his standing will affect the GOP\\u2019s position in the 2026 midterm elections and the race to succeed him in 2028 \\u2013 just as Biden\\u2019s weakened position created an enormous, and likely insurmountable, headwind for Harris this year.\\n\\nIssues that were overshadowed by the economy in the 2024 election could still weaken Trump, and by extension other Republicans. Ayres, for instance, says Trump and the GOP will be hurt if Kennedy is confirmed and his anti-vaccination rhetoric contributes to future outbreaks of childhood diseases like measles. And any move by Trump\\u2019s administration to restrict access to abortion \\u2013 for instance, by rolling back Biden\\u2019s moves to ease access to medication abortion \\u2013 could alienate voters who believed him when he said he believed the issue should now be left to the states. Polls leave little doubt that most voters are dubious of widespread pardons for the January 6 rioters \\u2013 something Trump has pledged to pursue within his first hours of a second term.\\n\\nBut the dynamics of Trump\\u2019s victory last month illuminate that issues more central to voters\\u2019 daily lives remain most likely to function as the pivot point of the next four years. Both McLaughlin, the Trump pollster, and Murphy, the Harris pollster, point to the same straightforward central explanation for why voters returned him to the White House. \\u201cVoters didn\\u2019t like the direction of the country and they thought he could make their lives better,\\u201d McLaughlin said. Echoed Murphy: \\u201cFor voters, he was just the guy from the other party when they were unhappy.\\u201d\\n\\nIf voters feel that their lives are improving over the next four years, the example of 2024 suggests they will suppress their other concerns about Trump and continue to support him, a trend that would benefit GOP candidates in 2026 and 2028. \\u201cHe knows that if he is successful everything else will take care of itself,\\u201d said McLaughlin. \\u201cHe knows his legacy is all contingent on having a strong economy.\\u201d\\n\\nBut if Trump doesn\\u2019t reward the faith of these conflicted voters by making progress on the issues that most concern them, they may inexorably turn their focus back toward their other hesitations about him, a trend that would hurt GOP candidates in the coming elections. \\u201cPerformance matters,\\u201d said Ayres. \\u201cPerformance drives job approval and job approval drives votes. It\\u2019s not more complicated than that.\\u201d\",\n",

Two body bags could also be seen on the street.\\n\\nThe block was cordoned off on Tuesday morning as Russian investigators continued combing the area.\\n\\nIn October, the UK placed sanctions on Kirillov, saying he had overseen the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine and acted as a \\\"significant mouthpiece for Kremlin disinformation\\\".\\n\\nUkraine's SBU has claimed Russia used chemical weapons more than 4,800 times under the general's leadership.\\n\\nMoscow denies the allegations.\\n\\nThe SK said it had \\\"opened a criminal case into the murder of two servicemen\\\".\\n\\n\\\"Investigators, forensic experts and operational services are working at the scene,\\\" it said.\\n\\n\\\"Investigative actions and operational search activities are being carried out aimed at establishing all the circumstances of the crime.\\\"\\n\\nRussian state news agencies reported that the explosive device - which killed Kirillov and his aide in Ryazansky Avenue - had an explosive force equivalent to 300g (0.7lb) of TNT.\\n\\nThey added that bomb experts and specialist search dogs had inspected the surrounding area and no other explosives had been found.\\n\\nExperts have told BBC Verify that judging from images of the scene, it appears the explosion was caused by an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), a type of homemade bomb which usually contains easily obtainable components, such as nails or glass.\\n\\nAssassinations of senior officials have been carried out in Russia before, but attacks in Moscow are rare.\\n\\nLiza, who lives one building away from the site of the blast, told the BBC that while she was not entirely surprised, the killing of Igor Kirillov was a \\\"shocking\\\" development.\\n\\n\\\"It's one thing reading about it in the news, it feels far, but when it happens next door, that's completely different and frightening,\\\" she tells me.\\n\\n\\\"Until now, [the war] felt as if it was happening a long way off \\u2013 now someone is dead, here, you can feel the consequences,\\\" Liza said, adding that \\\"unfortunately, I don't think things will calm down any time soon\\\".\\n\\nSeveral other local residents said they initially thought the loud noise they heard had come from a construction site.\\n\\nStudent Mikhail Mashkov, who lives in the building next door, told the AFP news agency he was woken up by a \\\"very loud explosion noise\\\", thinking \\\"something fell at the construction site\\\", before looking outside.\\n\\nOlga Bogomolova said she thought a container had fallen at the construction site but then realised \\\"it was a very strong explosion\\\", saw \\\"broken windows\\\" and that it was something else.\\n\\nPeople living in the area told the BBC of their deep sense of shock.\\n\\nEven after nearly three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, for many Muscovites, the war is something that is happening a long way away - something they only see on TV or on their phones.\\n\\nThe killing of a Russian general in Moscow is a sign that this war is very real and very close to home.\\n\\nUnder UK sanctions, Kirillov was subject to an assets freeze and travel ban.\\n\\nIn May, the US accused Russia of deploying chemical weapons as a \\\"method of warfare\\\" in Ukraine, in violation of international laws banning their use.\\n\\nState department officials said Russia used the choking agent chloropicrin to win \\\"battlefield gains\\\" over Ukraine.\\n\\nAccording to the SBU, Russian forces have used drones to drop chemical weapons on Ukrainian soldiers.\\n\\nUkrainian Col Artem Vlasiuk had previously said that more than 2,000 Ukrainian service members had been treated in hospital for chemical poisoning over the course of the war and three people had died.\\n\\nThe Kremlin rejected the accusations at the time, calling them \\\"baseless\\\".\",\n",

      "        \"text_content\": \"Canada's Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland has resigned from her post, citing disagreements with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on how to respond to incoming President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs.\\n\\nShe announced her resignation in a letter to Trudeau on Monday, in which she said the two have been \\\"at odds about the best path forward for Canada\\\", and pointed to the \\\"grave challenge\\\" posed by Trump's policy of \\\"aggressive economic nationalism\\\".\\n\\nFreeland said the decision comes after Trudeau informed her last week that he no longer wanted her to be his government's top economic adviser.\\n\\nHer resignation came hours before she was due to provide an annual fiscal government update in parliament.\\n\\nThe move may push Trudeau's already shaky minority government to the brink .\\n\\nAfter nine years in power, the prime minister has faced growing calls to resign over concerns he is a drag on his party's fortunes. The Liberal leader's approval rate has plummeted from 63% when he was first elected to 28% in June of this year, according to one poll tracker.\\n\\nFollowing Freeland's departure on Monday, five siting Liberal MP publicly called on Trudeau to step down.\\n\\n\\\"Let's put it this way - firing the minister of finance who has served you extremely well is not what I'd call a trustworthy move,\\\" Helena Jaczek, an MP from Markham-Stouffville in Ontario, told reporters, before saying that Trudeau should resign.\\n\\nAn emergency Liberal caucus meeting was set for 1700 local time (22:00 GMT).\\n\\nWithin hours of Freeland's announcement, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc was sworn in as her replacement. LeBlanc, who has been close friends with the prime minister since childhood, is considered one of his most loyal allies.\\n\\nTrudeau was present at the swearing-in - his first appearance in front of media since Freeland's announcement - but he did not provide any statements. His office and the finance department both did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.\\n\\nIn her publicly-shared resignation letter, Freeland said Canada needs to keep its \\\"fiscal powder dry\\\" to deal with the threat of sweeping tariffs from US President-elect Donald Trump.\\n\\nShe added this means \\\"eschewing costly political gimmicks\\\" that Canada cannot afford.\\n\\nTrump has promised to impose a levy of 25% on imported Canadian goods, which economists have warned would significantly hurt Canada's economy.\\n\\nReferencing the tariffs, Freeland called them a \\\"threat\\\" that needs to be taken \\\"extremely seriously\\\".\\n\\nShe added that this means \\\"pushing back against 'America First' economic nationalism\\\" and working with unity in response to these tariff threats.\\n\\nWhen the fall economic statement was released on Monday afternoon, it revealed a C$60b deficit ($42bn; \\u00a333bn) - far exceeding Freeland's C$40bn target.\\n\\nShe and Trudeau were reportedly also in disagreement over a series of recently-proposed policies by the prime minister designed to address the country's cost-of-living crisis.\\n\\nAmong them is a cheque of C$250 that the government wanted to send to every Canadian earning less than C$150,000 annually. These cheques were expected to cost the federal government a total of C$4.68bn.\\n\\nAnother is a temporary tax break on essential items during the holidays which is anticipated to cost C$1.6bn in lost tax revenue.\\n\\nFreeland's office had reportedly been concerned about the price of these two policies, saying they are economically unwise at a time when the country's deficit is growing.\\n\\nThe tax holiday has since been approved in the House of Commons, but the C$250-cheques hit a hurdle when the New Democratic Party (NDP) - a centre-left party in parliament - signalled it would not lend its support to the policy unless it is expanded.\\n\\nA poll by the Angus Reid Institute showed that four out of five Canadians viewed the cheques as a political move designed to win public goodwill as Trudeau's popularity plummets.\\n\\nIn response to Freeland's exit, Pierre Poilievre, leader of the opposition Conservative Party of Canada, called for a federal election as soon as possible.\\n\\n\\\"Everything is spiralling out of control. We simply cannot go on like this,\\\" he said, adding that her resignation comes \\\"at the very worst time\\\".\",\n",

So that felt comforting, safe, and you felt like you were being understood.\\\"\\n\\nDune: Prophecy is described by critics as \\\"a bracingly different sci-fi dominated by women at every level\\\", with fans in India delighted by Tabu's appearance in the show.\\n\\nWhile she says schedules aligned to enable her to play the role of Sister Francesca, the chance to work in a different environment with an international cast was appealing.\\n\\n\\\"I always love these experiences. Because I don't live in that world.\\\"\\n\\nShe says there were people from Serbia, Spain, the UK, Ukraine and Germany involved, which helped her understand different people and cultures.\\n\\n\\\"It was very exciting, adding much more fun and drama on screen, of course, but off screen,\\\" she says.\\n\\n\\\"I got to interact with people from so many different parts of the world.\\\"\\n\\nTabu's career in the industry spans several decades, with acting credits including other Western productions such as Life of Pi and A Suitable Boy.\\n\\nBut despite everything she's achieved, the actor says she's keen to not look backwards.\\n\\n\\\"Because I feel like I've stuttered [if I do].\\n\\n\\\"[Sometimes I feel like] I'm still new and I'm still learning so much.\\n\\n\\\"The one thing that I feel extremely grateful and overwhelmed by is I got a tremendous amount of love and respect from people or from my audiences.\\\"\\n\\nAnd she says she remains motivated by the types of roles she plays, like Francesca.\\n\\n\\\"That I should be able to experience this character in a completely new way.\\n\\n\\\"That I should be able to present this character in a completely new way [for the audience].\\n\\n\\\"Cinema is over 100 years old, they've been seeing stuff happening, actors and characters.\\\"\",\n",
