            "content": "He called a snap election, set to begin this Sunday, in which the French people would be given a choice: replicate the decision made in the European elections and hand the far right the keys to national governance, or help thwart them by backing his centrist Renaissance party, which since 2022 has served in a minority government, instead.  Indeed, a recent Ipsos poll showed that more voters trust Le Pen's party on the economy (25%) than the left-wing alliance (22%) or Macron's centrist alliance (20%)\u2014despite its lack of governing experience or warnings that a far-right government could usher in a Liz Truss-style economic meltdown of the kind seen when the short-lived British prime minister introduced billions of pounds in unfunded tax cuts before ultimately resigning in disgrace.  Should this election end in defeat for Renaissance, and in victory for either the New Popular Front or the National Rally, Macron will be forced to serve the remainder of his presidential term in a power-sharing arrangement\u2014an outcome that would almost certainly relegate him to the status of canard boiteux, or lame duck.  \u201cIt\u2019s a ragtag coalition,\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, says of the alliance, whose platform includes a pledge to reverse the unpopular pension reforms pushed through by Macron last year, as well as returning the French retirement age to 60 (down from 64). Dubbed the \u201cNew Popular Front\u201d\u2014which borrows its name from a short-lived political coalition between Socialists and Communists that emerged in response to the threat of fascism in the 1930s\u2014the four-party alliance has committed to campaign on a common platform with a joint list of candidates.",

At the heart of the rapid rise of the nationalist right, with its view of immigrants as a direct threat to the essence of France, there appears to lie a growing feeling among many French people that they are no longer at home in their own country.  \u201cNo French citizen would tolerate living in a house without doors or windows,\u201d Jordan Bardella, the smooth-talking 28-year-old symbol of the National Rally\u2019s advance to the brink of power, told France 3 TV this past week. They include a sense of dispossession, of neighborhoods transformed in dress and habits by the arrival of mainly Muslim immigrants from North Africa, and of lost identity in a fast-changing world.

In power, the National Rally wouldn\u2019t curtail individual rights and would be the guarantor of absolute respect for the rights of opposition parties \u201cbecause pluralism is a formidable wealth, as are freedom of expression and the circulation of ideas,\u201d he said.

PARIS (AP) \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron is warning voters against choosing the far right or the hard left, asserting that their divisive policies increase the risk of political \u201cconflict and civil war,\u201d ahead of Sunday\u2019s first round of crucial parliamentary elections.  He asserted that the National Rally\u2019s policies, detailed by the party\u2019s president Jordan Bardella on Monday, would \u201clead to civil war\u201d and are \u201can impoverishment program, because it\u2019s several thousand euros in hidden taxes every day and an impossibility of paying pensions and paying employees well.\u201d  President Emmanuel Macron is addressing French voters on Wednesday for the first times since he has called snap national election following a crushing defeat of his party by the far-right in the European vote. Macron said both the far-right National Rally and hard-left France Unbowed bring bad responses to \u201creal problems\u201d because they \u201crespond in some way by increasing conflict and civil war.\u201d",

The party\u2019s \u201cFrance first\u201d policies on employment and benefits are, meanwhile, intended to place Paris on a collision course with the European Union, at a time when the radical right is on the rise elsewhere.  Humiliated by Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally party (RN) at this month\u2019s European elections, Mr Macron opted to call the French electorate\u2019s bluff, calculating that the prospect of a radical-right prime minister in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e would \u201cclarify\u201d its thinking.  Mr Macron\u2019s centrist Together movement languishes in a distant third place, well behind the New Popular Front (NPF), an alliance of\u00a0leftwing and progressive parties which is set to be the main challenger to Ms Le Pen in numerous\u00a0contests.  For Ms Le Pen, with her eyes on the prize of the next presidential elections, the more dysfunctional mainstream French politics becomes,\u00a0the better. ",

Macron told the podcast \u201cGeneration Do It Yourself\u201d that the manifesto of the RN party \u2014 which election pollsters put in first place \u2014 and their solutions to deal with fears over crime and immigration were based upon \u201cstigmatization or division\u201d.  Macron made the same criticism of the France Unbowed (LFI) extreme left-wing party, which forms part of the New Popular Front coalition. ",

For decades, the National Rally was the pariah of French politics \u2014 deemed so dangerous that politicians from other parties refused to engage with its members.  Originally called the National Front, the party was founded in 1972 as the political arm of New Order, whose members believed democracy was doomed to fail.",

Asked to respond to Macron\u2019s comments, RN president Jordan Bardella - seen as a possible prime minister if the RN wins the most votes in the election - replied to M6 TV: \u201cA president should not say that. Do It Yourself that the manifesto of the RN party \u2013 which election pollsters put in first place \u2013 and their solutions to deal with fears over crime and immigration were based upon \u201cstigmatisation or division\u201d.
