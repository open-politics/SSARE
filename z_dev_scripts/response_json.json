In the past days, the French president’s allies have warned of the risks France faces if voters turn to the far right or the far left, in particular the risk of economic turmoil.  France is ‘going to the dogs,’ Macron’s inner circle despairs In their hour of greatest need for a liberal successor to the country’s president, France’s centrists are in panicky disarray.  The far right’s answer to insecurity “reduces people to their religion or their origin” and therefore “pushes people towards civil war,” he said in an interview Monday with the podcast “Generation Do It Yourself.”  Recent polls suggest the National Rally would win 35 percent in the first round on Sunday, ahead of a left wing alliance, which includes the France Unbowed party on 27 percent and Macron’s centrists on 19 percent.

Indeed, a recent Ipsos poll showed that more voters trust Le Pen's party on the economy (25%) than the left-wing alliance (22%) or Macron's centrist alliance (20%)—despite its lack of governing experience or warnings that a far-right government could usher in a Liz Truss-style economic meltdown of the kind seen when the short-lived British prime minister introduced billions of pounds in unfunded tax cuts before ultimately resigning in disgrace.  Should this election end in defeat for Renaissance, and in victory for either the New Popular Front or the National Rally, Macron will be forced to serve the remainder of his presidential term in a power-sharing arrangement—an outcome that would almost certainly relegate him to the status of canard boiteux, or lame duck.  “It’s a ragtag coalition,” Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, says of the alliance, whose platform includes a pledge to reverse the unpopular pension reforms pushed through by Macron last year, as well as returning the French retirement age to 60 (down from 64). Dubbed the “New Popular Front”—which borrows its name from a short-lived political coalition between Socialists and Communists that emerged in response to the threat of fascism in the 1930s—the four-party alliance has committed to campaign on a common platform with a joint list of candidates.",

Bardella, who could become prime minister if voters choose a majority of his National Rally party's candidates in the two-round parliamentary election on June 30 and July 7, unveiled his program at a news conference.  In power, the National Rally wouldn’t curtail individual rights and would be the guarantor of absolute respect for the rights of opposition parties “because pluralism is a formidable wealth, as are freedom of expression and the circulation of ideas,” he said.  He said that cellphones would also be banned for pupils starting from the new academic year in September, including in high schools, and students would be obliged to address teachers as “vous” – the more formal way in French of saying “you\" — rather than “tu.”  In Europe, “our arrival in office will also mark France’s return to the European stage to defend its interests,” Bardella said, explaining that he was willing to negotiate “exceptions” to EU rules.

The party’s “France first” policies on employment and benefits are, meanwhile, intended to place Paris on a collision course with the European Union, at a time when the radical right is on the rise elsewhere.  Humiliated by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally party (RN) at this month’s European elections, Mr Macron opted to call the French electorate’s bluff, calculating that the prospect of a radical-right prime minister in the Élysée would “clarify” its thinking.

France’s Parliamentary Elections Advertisement France’s Parliamentary Elections Supported by France’s Far-Right National Rally Rebranded Itself. Mr. Macron soon called a surprise snap election for the powerful National Assembly, and polls suggest that the National Rally might be poised to win those, too.  For decades, the National Rally was the pariah of French politics — deemed so dangerous that politicians from other parties refused to engage with its members.  Originally called the National Front, the party was founded in 1972 as the political arm of New Order, whose members believed democracy was doomed to fail.",

He asserted that the National Rally’s policies, detailed by the party's president Jordan Bardella on Monday, would “lead to civil war” and are “an impoverishment program, because it’s several thousand euros in hidden taxes every day and an impossibility of paying pensions and paying employees well.”  Macron said both the far-right National Rally and hard-left France Unbowed bring bad responses to “real problems” because they “respond in some way by increasing conflict and civil war.” The hard-left France Unbowed encourages tensions between communities for electoral purposes, he asserted, arguing it also means “civil war” because it “reduces people to their religious or ethnic group.”  Macron is aligned against both the National Rally and the New Popular Front, a coalition of far- to center-left parties that includes France Unbowed.",

Asked to respond to Macron’s comments, RN president Jordan Bardella - seen as a possible prime minister if the RN wins the most votes in the election - replied to M6 TV: “A president should not say that. Do It Yourself that the manifesto of the RN party – which election pollsters put in first place – and their solutions to deal with fears over crime and immigration were based upon “stigmatisation or division”.
